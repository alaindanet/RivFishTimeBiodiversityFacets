	abstract = {Arid ecosystems are liable to undergo sudden discontinuous transitions from a vegetated to a desert state as a result of human pressure and climate change. A predictive framework about the conditions under which such transitions occur is lacking. Here, we derive and analyze a general model describing the spatial dynamics of vegetation in arid ecosystems considering local facilitation as an essential process. We investigate the conditions under which continuous or discontinuous transitions from a vegetated to a desert state are likely to occur. We focus on arid ecosystems but our approach is sufficiently general to be applied to other ecosystems with severe environmental conditions. The model exhibits bistability and vegetation patchiness. High local facilitation decreases the risk of discontinuous transitions. Moreover, for arid ecosystems where local facilitation is a driving process, vegetation patchiness indicates proximity to a transition point, but does not allow distinguishing between continuous and discontinuous transitions.},

	abstract = {The concept of ecosystem services introduced a new view on the relationship between biodiversity and human well being. But are both concepts, biodiversity and ecosystem services, mutually beneficial? We will try to unravel part of this much debated question in three steps.

Firstly, a general hypothesis describing the present link between biodiversity, ecosystem services and land use intensity is tested for the region of Flanders (13.682 km2). The spatial exercise illustrates that even in a densely populated area as Flanders (539 inhabitants/km2), scores for biodiversity and ecosystem services show a clear decline with an increase in land use intensity. Despite the overall congruence of the rough indicators of biodiversity and ecosystem services used in this exercise, the need for new indicators integrating key structural and functional aspects of the ecosystem is highlighted.

In a second step a target scheme is proposed describing the relation between biodiversity and land use intensity, for the long-term future. In this conceptual framework the need for the conservation and restoration of biodiversity hot spots is emphasized. At the same time the importance of the search for an environmental ‘bottom line’ is stressed. What is the minimum amount of biodiversity needed to reach sustainable use? And what is the critical point for human impact beyond which society will largely depend on the import of ecosystem services to sustain or increase its well-being?

In a third step, ecosystem management is used as a concept to bridge the gap between the present and the target scheme. Ecosystem management is divided into three focal zones. (1) For the remaining zones with a high biodiversity and a low intensity of land use, a biodiversity conservation based approach is needed. (2) For most rural areas with multifunctional uses and a good state as a future perspective, a focus on ecosystem services is a good point of departure. (3) In the built-up areas and intensively used agricultural sites, beyond the minimum standards for land use intensity, a technological service based approach will be necessary.

A division of ecosystem management into these three zones confirms the complementarity of biodiversity and ecosystem services for policy and management strategies. The concept of this triple division can help to facilitate the discussion of a joint achievement of the goals for biodiversity and ecosystem services in the field.},

	abstract = {Understanding the behaviour of complex environmental systems, particularly as critical thresholds are approached, is vitally important in many contexts. Among these are the moisture-limited vegetation systems in semi-arid (SA) regions of the World, which support approximately 36 per cent of the human population, maintain considerable biodiversity and which are susceptible to rapid stress-induced collapse. Change in spatially self-organized vegetation patterning has previously been proposed as a means of identifying approaching thresholds in these systems. In this paper, a newly developed cellular automata model is used to explore spatial patterning and also the temporal dynamics of SA vegetation cover. Results show, for the first time, to my knowledge, in a cellular automata model, that ‘critical slowdown’ (a pronounced reduction in post-perturbation recovery rates) provides clear signals of system fragility as major thresholds are approached. A consequence of slowing recovery rates is the appearance of quasi-stable population states and increased potential for perturbation-induced multi-staged population collapse. The model also predicts a non-patterned cover where environmental stress levels are high, or where more moderate stress levels are accompanied by frequent perturbations. In the context of changing climatic and environmental pressures, these results provide observable indicators of fragility and threshold proximity in SA vegetation systems that have direct relevance to management policies.},

	abstract = {Seed dispersal and establishment are critical stages for plants in arid environments, where vegetation is spatially organized in patches with suitable and unsuitable sites for establishment. Theoretical studies suggest that the ability of vegetation to self-organize in patchy spatial patterns is a critical property for plant survival in arid environments, and is a consequence of a scale-dependent feedback between plants and resource availability. Field observations show that plants of arid environments evolved towards short dispersal distance (proxichory) and that the investment in reproduction increases along an aridity gradient. Here, we investigated how plant dispersal strategies affect spatial organization and associated scale-dependent feedback in arid ecosystems. We addressed this research question using a model where the spatio-temporal vegetation patterns were driven by scale-dependent feedbacks between plants and soil water availability. In the model, water availability limited vegetation growth, seed production and establishment ability. Seed dispersal was modelled with an integrodifferential equation that mimicked important plant dispersal characteristics (i.e. fecundity, mean dispersal distance and establishment ability). Results showed that, when the investment in fecundity was relatively high, short seed dispersal helped maintaining higher mean biomass in the system, improving the vegetation efficiency in water use. However, higher fecundity induced a large cost, and high mean biomass could be sustained only with high establishment ability. Considering low establishment ability, intermediate fecundity was more efficient than low fecundity in maintaining high plant biomass under the most arid conditions. Consistently, plant dispersal strategies that maintained more biomass were related to a vegetation spatial organization that allowed the most efficient soil water redistribution, through the strengthening of the scale-dependent feedback. The efficient dispersal strategies and spatial patterns in the model are commonly observed in plants of arid environments. Thus, dispersal strategies in arid environments might contribute to a favourable spatial organization and associated scale-dependent feedback.},

Although there is a good understanding of the probabilities of seedling establishment of Bromus pictus in relation to location within these patches, these probabilities account for only a portion of the spatial dynamics of the community. The objective of this paper was to assess the pattern and dynamics of Bromus pictus seed availability in this community, which represent the other portion of the recruitment equation. We first evaluated its seed bank along transects. Plant- or litter-covered areas had 85\% of the sampled seeds; however, they accounted for 55\% of the area. Bare-soil areas had seeds only if they were located close (≤10 cm) to a plant or litter microsite. In a second study, we analyzed the movement of seeds using pitfall traps. Traps located near plants captured seed amounts similar to those from traps located in bare-ground areas (far from plants). The contrast between the high number of seeds in transit and the low number of seeds retained by bare-ground microsites illustrates the importance of lateral secondary movement of seeds. We used this information on seed distribution and previous data about establishment probabilities to estimate the spatial pattern of recruitment. Microsites that are vegetated or close to individual plants are expected to recruit the greatest number of individuals. Vegetation patches play an important role in modifying ecological processes in arid and semiarid communities. Our results highlight the importance of seed distribution in the formation and maintenance of these patches.},

(1) How do community-weighted mean (CWM) trait values of 23 functional traits measured on 34 plant species vary along a gradient of aridity under grazed and ungrazed conditions in an arid steppe? (2) How does variation in our CWM trait values differ from those of more mesic grasslands?
Location
Eastern Morocco.
Methods
We measured relative abundance and functional traits along a short aridity gradient over two consecutive years at five heavily grazed sites, each with an exclosure preventing grazing. We analysed the relationship between aridity, grazing, and the expression of CWM trait values using ordination methods and a fourth-corner analysis.
Results
Unconstrained and constrained ordinations identified three distinct suites of temporally consistent functional traits that co-varied with aridity and grazing, and the fourth-corner analysis identified a number of significant but weak trait–environment associations. Grazing selected for short, fast-growing annual species with high SLA, high pastoral value and low seed mass, while aridity selected for species possessing succulent leaves with high δ13C leaf content, spines, low LDMC and short stature, although the relative importance of precipitation and grazing changed between years.
Conclusions
Although distinct from more mesic grasslands, our study sites exhibited patterns of trait correlations that were similar to the worldwide leaf economics spectrum. These correlation patterns represented three groups that were reminiscent of Grime's C-S-R model. Direct ordinations supported this interpretation. Temporal variation in our results was due in part to precipitation fluctuations. Our results also indicated selection for a grazing avoidance strategy under heavy grazing. Integrating plant functional traits in conservation and management of arid ecosystems represents a novel and challenging task to ensure more sustainable use of these lands.},

	abstract = {Heathlands in the northwest of Spain have been traditionally used by domestic herbivores as a food resource. However, their abandonment in the past decades has promoted a high incidence of wildfires, threatening biodiversity. Sheep and goats exhibit different grazing behavior, affecting rangelands dynamics in a different way, but the botanical and structural composition may also affect such dynamics. The aim of this article was to compare the grazing effects of sheep and goats on three different heathland types: previously burned grass- or gorse (Ulex gallii Planchon)-dominated and unburned heather (Erica spp.)-dominated shrublands. Two grazing treatments (sheep or goats) were applied in each vegetation type in a factorial design with two replicates (12 experimental plots). A small fenced area was excluded from grazing in each plot (control treatment). The experiment was carried out from 2003 to 2006, and the grazing season extended from May to October-November. Plant cover, canopy height, and phytomass amount and composition were assessed in each plot. Results showed that goats controlled shrub encroachment, phytomass accumulation, and canopy height more than sheep in either burned grass- and gorse- and unburned heather-dominated shrublands. It was accompanied by a higher increase of herbaceous species under goat grazing. Nevertheless, plant dynamics showed different trends between the three vegetation types studied. Grazing effects were more important in previously burned grass-dominated heathlands than in unburned heather-dominated shrublands. At the end of the experiment (May 2006), shrub cover, height, and woody phytomass were significantly higher in the ungrazed enclosures than in the grazed plots. Small ruminant grazing, especially with goats, is proposed as an efficient tool to reduce shrub encroachment and woody phytomass accumulation in heathlands, thus reducing fire hazard, although these grazing effects depend on heathland composition. /// Los brezales-tojales en el noroeste de España han sido utilizados tradicionalmente por herbívoros domésticos como fuente de alimento. Sin embargo, su abandono en las últimas décadas está promoviendo una alta incidencia de incendios forestales, amenazando la biodiversidad. El ganado ovino y caprino muestra diferentes conductas de pastoreo, afectando la dinámica en los pastizales, pero la composición botánica y estructural también puede afectar dicha dinámica. El objetivo de este trabajo fue comparar los efectos del pastoreo del ganado ovino y caprino en tres diferentes tipos de brezales-tojales: pastizales previamente quemados dominados por vegetación herbácea (gramíneas) o por el tojo (Ulex gallii Planchon), y no quemados dominados por el brezo (Erica spp.). Dos tratamientos de pastoreo (ovino o caprino) fueron aplicados en cada tipo de vegetación en un diseño factorial con dos repeticiones (12 parcelas experimentales). Una pequeña área cercada fue excluida del pastoreo en cada parcela (tratamiento control). El experimento se realizó del 2003 al 2006, y la temporada de pastoreo se extendió de Mayo a Octubre-Noviembre. Se evaluaron en cada parcela la cobertura vegetal, la altura del dosel, y la cantidad y composición de fitomasa. Los resultados mostraron que las cabras controlaron la invasión de arbustos, la acumulación de fitomasa y la altura del dosel más que las ovejas en cualquiera de los pastizales quemados de grama y tojo, y los pastizales no quemados dominados por el brezo. Lo que estuvo acompañado de un mayor incremento en especies de herbáceas bajo el pastoreo caprino. Sin embargo, la dinámica vegetal mostró diferentes tendencias entre los tres tipos de vegetación estudiados. Los efectos del pastoreo fueron más importantes en los brezales-tojales previamente quemados dominados por las gramíneas que en los matorrales no quemados dominados por el brezo. Al final del estudio (mayo 2006), la cobertura arbustiva, la altura y la biomasa de las leñosas fueron significativamente mayores en los matorrales sin pastoreo que en las parcelas pastadas. El pastoreo con pequeños rumiantes, especialmente con cabras, se propone como una herramienta eficiente para reducir la invasión de arbustos y la acumulación de fitomasa leñosa en los brezales-tojales reduciendo así el riesgo de incendios, aunque estos efectos del pastoreo dependen de la composición del brezal-tojal.},

	doi = {10.1023/A:1004327224729},
	abstract = {A leaf-height-seed (LHS) plant ecology strategy scheme is proposed. The axes would be specific leaf area SLA (light-capturing area deployed per dry mass allocated), height of the plant's canopy at maturity, and seed mass. All axes would be log-scaled. The strategy of a species would be described by its position in the volume formed by the three axes. The advantages of the LHS scheme can be understood by comparing it to Grime's CSR scheme, which has Competitors, Stress-tolerators and Ruderals at the corners of a triangle. The CSR triangle is widely cited as expressing important strategic variation between species. The C–S axis reflects variation in responsiveness to opportunities for rapid growth; in the LHS scheme, SLA reflects the same type of variation. The R axis reflects coping with disturbance; in the LHS scheme, height and seed mass reflect separate aspects of coping with disturbance. A plant ecology strategy scheme that permitted any species worldwide to be readily positioned within the scheme could bring substantial benefits for improved meta-analysis of experimental results, for placing detailed ecophysiology in context, and for coping with questions posed by global change. In the CSR triangle the axes are defined by reference to concepts, there is no simple protocol for positioning species beyond the reference datasets within the scheme, and consequently benefits of worldwide comparison have not materialized. LHS does permit any vascular land plant species to be positioned within the scheme, without time-consuming measurement of metabolic rates or of field performance relative to other species. The merits of the LHS scheme reside (it is argued) in this potential for worldwide comparison, more than in superior explanatory power within any particular vegetation region. The LHS scheme avoids also two other difficulties with the CSR scheme: (a) It does not prejudge that there are no viable strategies under high stress and high disturbance (the missing quadrant in the CSR triangle compared to a two-axis rectangle); (b) It separates out two distinct aspects of the response to disturbance, height at maturity expressing the amount of growth attempted between disturbances, and seed mass (inverse of seed output per unit reproductive effort) expressing the capacity to colonize growth opportunities at a distance. The advantage of LHS axes defined through a single readily-measured variable needs to be weighed against the disadvantage that single plant traits may not capture as much strategy variation as CSR's multi-trait axes. It is argued that the benefits of potential worldwide comparison do actually outweigh any decrease in the proportion of meaningful variation between species that is captured. Further, the LHS scheme opens the path to quantifying what proportion of variation in any other ecologically-relevant trait is correlated with the LHS axes. This quantification could help us to move forward from unprofitable debates of the past 30 years, where CSR opponents have emphasized patterns that were not accommodated within the scheme, while CSR proponents have emphasized patterns that the scheme did account for.},

This theory argues that webs of feedbacks stabilise vegetation composition and structure, and that abrupt state shifts can occur if stabilising feedbacks are weakened. However, it is difficult to identify stabilising feedback loops and the disturbance thresholds beyond which state changes occur. Here, we argue that doing this requires a synthetic approach blending observation, experimentation, simulation, conceptual models, and narratives. Using forest boundaries and large mammal extinctions, we illustrate how a multifaceted research program can advance understanding of feedback-driven ecosystem change. Our integrative approach has applicability to other complex macroecological systems controlled by numerous feedbacks where controlled experimentation is impossible.},

Conversely, the interaction with other co-occurring species has scarcely been addressed, despite the fact that the entire community may affect plant performance. We used woody vegetation patches as models to evaluate community facilitation in semi-arid steppes. We characterized biotic and physical attributes of 53 woody patches (patch size, litter accumulation, canopy density, vegetation cover, species number and identity, and phylogenetic distance), and soil fertility (organic C and total N), and evaluated their relative importance for the performance of seedlings of Pistacia lentiscus, a keystone woody species in western Mediterranean steppes. Seedlings were planted underneath the patches, and on their northern and southern edges. Woody patches positively affected seedling survival but not seedling growth. Soil fertility was higher underneath the patches than elsewhere. Physical and biotic attributes of woody patches affected seedling survival, but these effects depended on microsite conditions. The composition of the community of small shrubs and perennial grasses growing underneath the patches controlled seedling performance. An increase in Stipa tenacissima and a decrease in Brachypodium retusum increased the probability of survival. The cover of these species and other small shrubs, litter depth and community phylogenetic distance, were also related to seedling survival. Seedlings planted on the northern edge of the patches were mostly affected by attributes of the biotic community. These traits were of lesser importance in seedlings planted underneath and in the southern edge of patches, suggesting that constraints to seedling establishment differed within the patches. Our study highlights the importance of taking into consideration community attributes over pair-wise interactions when evaluating the outcome of ecological interactions in multi-specific communities, as they have profound implications in the composition, function and management of semi-arid steppes.},

* Two contrasting hypotheses account for variation in leaf defences among species. The first predicts that a slow life history, which is characteristic of larger seeded species adapted to resource-limited environments, is associated with well-defended leaves. The second, apparency theory, predicts that elevated leaf defences are necessitated for species that are more detectable to herbivores.


* Here we use comparative methods and a global data set to test (i) the relationship between seed size and leaf defences and (ii) the relationship between clumping (spatial apparency) and leaf defences.


* We found that seed size was positively related to leaf fracture toughness, but not phenolics or tannin concentration and that spatial aggregation was unrelated to leaf defences.


* Synthesis. Our results suggest that larger seed size and increased leaf toughness are correlated as part of a trait syndrome associated with a slow, resource-limited life history, not clumped dispersion and increased spatial apparency.},

	abstract = {* 1In response to my essay review that attempted to reconcile the plant strategy theories of Grime and Tilman, Grime rejects five tenets that I had identified in his theories that were incomplete, inconsistent, or incorrect.
* 2Grime fails to adequately address three of these concerns. Regarding the other concerns, it is clear that the concept of relative importance needs to be developed further. For example, if both competition and the stress of low nutrient supplies can remove species from a given environment, then neither can be elevated over the other without being tautological.
* 3With regards to Tilman's response, it is clear that it will be important to be explicit about the relationship between data and models. At times, Tilman is neither evaluating individual models with a Popperian approach nor comparing contrasting models in a Bayesian fashion. As it stands, it is unclear what is required for Tilman to reject R* as the mechanism of competition, or whether it passes some undetermined threshold of acceptability.
* 4Comparing concentration reduction to supply pre-emption as the mechanism of competition recommends supply pre-emption on many fronts. Supply pre-emption better represents the movement of nutrients in soil solution. Assuming well-mixed soil solutions can theoretically lead to improper prediction of competitive outcomes. Empirically, there are examples where R* does not predict outcomes for competition for nutrients, and supply pre-emption appears to generate metrics (root length density) that are equivalent if not better than concentration reduction (R*) at explaining these outcomes.
* 5The next plant strategies paradigm will not be a result of choosing either Grime's or Tilman's theories, but represent a synthesis of the two sets of theories while also incorporating novel concepts and research. I agree with Tilman that more research is needed in understanding mechanisms of coexistence, but there still remains large gaps in our understanding of plant traits and growth that limit our understanding of competition for nutrients and will likely constrain our understanding of coexistence even more.},

	abstract = {* 1The theories of Grime and Tilman are ambitious attempts to unify disparate theories regarding the construction of plants, their interaction with the environment and the assembly of communities. After over two decades of parallel research, their ideas have not been reconciled, hindering progress in understanding the functioning of ecosystems.
* 2Grime's theories do not adequately incorporate the importance of non-heterogeneous supplies of nutrients and how these supplies are partitioned over long time scales, are inconsistent regarding the importance of disturbance in nutrient-limited habitats and need to reconsider the carbon economy of shade-tolerant plants.
* 3Failure to account for differences between aquatic and terrestrial systems in how resource supplies are partitioned led Tilman to develop a shifting set of theories that have become reduced in mechanistic detail over time. The most recent highlighted the reduction of nutrient concentrations in soil solution, although it can no longer be derived from any viable mechanistic model. The slow diffusion of nutrients in soils means that the reduction of average soil solution nutrient concentrations cannot explain competitive exclusion.
* 4Although neither theory, nor a union of the two, adequately characterizes the dynamics of terrestrial plant assemblages, the complementarity in their assumptions serve as an important foundation for future theory and research.
* 5Reconciling the approaches of Grime and Tilman leads to six scenarios for competition for nutrients and light, with the outcome of each depending on the ability of plants to pre-empt supplies. Under uniform supplies, pulses or patches, light competition requires leaf area dominance, while nutrient competition requires root length dominance. There are still important basic questions regarding the nature of nutrient supplies that will need to be answered, but recent research brings us closer to a unified set of theories on resource competition.},

	abstract = {Two of the central hypotheses of the triangular model of primary plant strategies were tested by a movel technique involving seven grasses of contrasted ecology grown in pure stands and an additive mixture on an experimental matrix of crossed gradients of mineral nutrient stress and vegetation disturbance. The experimental design allowed reductions in vegetative and reproductive vigor resulting from interspecific competition to be distinguished from those arising from direct effects of nutrient stress and vegetation disturbance. It was also possible to determine the extent to which competitive suppression of each species was affected by stress and disturbance. In isolation, all species showed maximum vegetative and reproductive vigor at high soil fertility and low disturbance. In the mixture, absolute reductions in biomass and flowering due to competition were greatest at high soil fertility and low disturbance, and the species of most extreme strategy became restricted to areas of the matrix broadly consistent with those predicted by strategy classification. When standardized for differences in biomass in pure stands, the effect of competition remained relatively constant across the stress-disturbance matrix for all species except Poa annua, which was less restricted by competition at high intensities of stress. There were marked and consistent differences between species in their susceptibility to competition. At both high and low soil fertility, two species of natural occurrence on infertile soils (Festuca ovina, Bromus erectus) were poor competitors relative to Arrhenatherum elatius, a widespread dominant of productive grasslands. The effect of competition was least severe on flowering of annuals in low-stress portions of the matrix. If competition is assessed simply as the percentage of reduction in biomass between pure and mixed stands it appears that competition intensity is constant across different intensities of stress and disturbances. However, observations that maximum reductions in biomass coincided with low stress and low disturbance, that competition decreased in importance as a factor reducing yield and flowering (relative to stress and disturbance) as stress and disturbance intensities increased, and that there was a consistently inferior competitive ability of plants from infertile soils at all positions on the matrix all support the hypothesis that competition declines in importance as a vegetation determinant in the vegetation of infertile soils.},

	abstract = {Body size of vertebrate herbivores is strongly linked to other life history traits, most notably (1) tolerance of low quality forage and (2) vulnerability to predation, which both impact the composition and dynamics of natural communities. However, no study has thus far explored how the combination of these two body-size related traits affects the long-term composition and dynamics of the herbivore and plant communities. We made a simple model of ordinary differential equations and simulated a grassland system with three herbivore species (small, medium, large) and two predator species (small, large) to investigate how the combination of low-quality tolerance and predation-vulnerability structure the herbivore and plant community. We found that facilitation and competition between different-sized herbivores and predation by especially small predators stimulate coexistence among herbivore species. Furthermore, the interaction between different-sized herbivores and predators generated cyclical succession in the plant community, i.e. alternating periods of short vegetation dominated by high-quality plants, with periods of tall vegetation dominated by low-quality plants. Our results suggest that cyclical succession in plant communities is more likely to occur when a predator predominantly preys on small herbivore species. Large predators also play an important role, as their addition relaxed the set of conditions under which cyclical succession occurred. Consequently, our model predictions suggest that a diverse predator community plays an important role in the long-term dynamics and maintenance of diversity in both the herbivore and plant community.},

Thus, net effect of biotic interactions is often positive in stressed grasslands, where dominant species and litter can protect the subordinate species. Besides facilitation, niche partitioning can also support species coexistence leading to limiting similarity between subordinate species. Our aim was to provide a detailed analysis of fine-scale biotic interactions in stressed alkali grasslands. We supposed, that there are positive relationships between the main biomass fractions and species richness. We expected the expansion of trait ranges and the increase of trait dissimilarity with increasing biomass scores (total litter, green biomass of dominant species) and species richness. We studied the relationships between main biomass fractions, species richness, functional diversity and functional trait indices (ranges, weighted means and Rao indices). We used fine-scale biomass sampling in nine stands of dry alkali grasslands dominated by Festuca pseudovina. The detected relationships were always positive between the main biomass fractions (green biomass of dominant species, total litter and green biomass of subordinate species) and species richness. We found that the green biomass of dominant species and total litter increased ranges and dissimilarity of functional traits. Our results suggest that in dry alkali grasslands facilitation is crucial in shaping vegetation composition. The green biomass of dominant species and total litter increased the biomass production of subordinate species leading to overyielding. We found that mechanisms of facilitation and limiting similarity were jointly shaping the species coexistence in stressed grasslands, such as alkali grasslands.},

	abstract = {In semi-arid ecosystems, vegetation is heterogeneously distributed, with plant species often associating in patches. These associations between species are not constant, but depend on the particular response of each species to environmental factors. Here, we investigated how plant species associations change in response to livestock grazing in a semi-arid ecosystem, Cabo de Gata-Níjar Natural Park in South East Spain. We established linear point-intercept transects at four sites with different grazing intensity, and recorded all species at each point. We investigated plant associations by comparing the number of times that each pair of species occurred at the same spatial point (co-occurrences), with the expected number of times based on species abundances. We also assessed associations for each shrub and grass species by considering all their pairs of associations and for the whole plant community by considering all pairs of associations on each site. At all sites, the plant community had a negative pattern of association, with fewer co-occurrences than expected. Negative association in the plant community increased at maximum grazing intensity. Most species associated as expected, particularly grass species, and positive associations were most important at intermediate grazing intensities. No species changed its type of association along the grazing gradient. We conclude that in the present plant community, grazing-resistant species compete among themselves and segregate in space. Some shrub species act as refuges for grazing-sensitive species that benefit from being spatially associated with shrub species, particularly at intermediate grazing intensities where positive associations were highest. At high grazing intensity, these shrubs can no longer persist and positive associations decrease due to the disappearance of refuges. Spatial associations between plant species and their response to grazing help identify the factors that organize plant communities, and may contribute to improving management of semi-arid ecosystems.},

	abstract = {In recent times, network theory has become a useful tool to study the structure of the interactions in ecological communities. However, typically, these approaches focus on a particular kind of interaction while neglecting other possible interactions present in the ecosystem. Here, we present an ecological network for plant communities that consider simultaneously positive and negative interactions, which were derived from the spatial association and segregation between plant species. We employed this network to study the structure and the association strategies in a semiarid plant community of Cabo de Gata-Níjar Natural Park, SE Spain, and how they changed in 4 sites that differed in stocking rate. Association strategies were obtained from the partitions of the network, built based on a relaxed structural balance criterion. We found that grazing simplified the structure of the plant community. With increasing stocking rate species with no significant associations became dominant and the number of partitions decreased in the plant community. Independently of stocking rate, many species presented an associative strategy in the plant community because they benefit from the association to certain ‘nurse’ plants. These ‘nurses’ together with species that developed a segregating strategy, intervened in most of the interactions in the community. Ecological networks that combine links with different signs provide a new insight to analyze the structure of natural communities and identify the species which play a central role in them.},

	abstract = {In a laboratory experiment seedlings of 24 perennial herbaceous prairie species were offered to the omnivorous cricket Acheta domestica in an extended feeding trial. Leaf damage was monitored daily allowing an index of palatability to be calculated for each plant species.  The index of palatability successfully predicted relative abundance within the same set of species in an independently-conducted study involving community assembly from seed in low-fertility plots.  These results support the hypothesis that resistance to herbivory may be an important component of plant fitness in unproductive vegetation. However, the correlation between palatability and community composition may be interpreted as a positive association between traits that lead to high competitive ability and herbivory resistance.  There is a need to establish whether the success of the dominant grasses at Cedar Creek arises from their superior ability to capture nitrogen from low external concentrations or is, rather, due to their superior ability to minimise nitrogen loss to herbivores.},

	abstract = {* Grime's CSR and Tilman's resource-ratio theories are two major contributions to our understanding of plant community dynamics. They have both been corroborated empirically, whilst providing several contradictory predictions. Notably, contrary to Tilman, Grime predicts that competition for soil resources is unimportant on poor soils.

* We show that Grime's CSR theory can be modelled with the same type of differential equations for resource and plant biomass dynamics used by Tilman in his resource-ratio theory.

* Using this unified modelling framework, we demonstrate that both models predict intense competition for soil resources on poor soils, as long as biomass loss per unit mass is modelled as a size-independent process. When considering biomass loss per unit mass as a size-dependent process mimicking farming activities, both models predict a unimodal relationship between soil fertility and the intensity of soil resource competition, and a decreasing relationship between disturbance rate and resource competition.

* Synthesis. Our modelling analysis reveals that the resource-ratio and CSR theories make different predictions regarding competition on poor soils, not because of their differing schemes of plant strategies, but because of the different disturbance types that they are considering. Tilman's predictions apply to little disturbed natural habitats, whilst Grime's predictions apply to disturbed ones.},

Crucially, CSR plant strategy theory suggests that stress and sporadic resource availability favour conservative phenotypes, whereas the resource-ratio hypothesis views the spatial heterogeneity of resources as selecting for optimal foraging in chronically unproductive habitats. Which view is most realistic?
* 2The ecophysiology literature demonstrates that stress is comprised of two processes: (1) limitation of resource supply to metabolism; and (2) damage to biomembranes, proteins and genetic material (chronic stress). Thus stress is defined mechanistically as the suboptimal performance of metabolism.
* 3Adaptations to limitation buffer metabolism against variability in external resource supply; internal storage pools are more consistent. Chronic stress elicits the same ancient cellular stress response in all cellular life: investment in stress metabolites that preserve the integrity and compartmentalization of metabolic components in concert with molecular damage-repair mechanisms.
* 4The cellular stress response was augmented by morphological innovations during the Silurian–Devonian terrestrial radiation, during which nutrient limitation appears to have been a principal selection pressure (sensu CSR theory).
* 5The modern stress–tolerator syndrome is conservative and supports metabolism in limiting or fluctuating environmental conditions: standing resource pools with high investment/maintenance costs impose high internal diffusion resistances and limit inherent growth rate (sensu CSR theory).
* 6The resource-ratio hypothesis cannot account for the cellular stress response or the crucial role of ombrotrophy in primary succession. CSR theory agrees with current understanding of the cellular stress response, terrestrial radiation and modern adaptations recorded in chronically unproductive habitats, and is applicable as CSR classification.},

* 2Resource reduction, as summarized in R*, is readily observed. Soil concentrations of nitrate and water are decreased by plant uptake, and are lowered to different levels by different species. Tests have shown R* theory to correctly predict competitive outcomes for a variety of organisms and ecosystems.
* 3Consumer-resource mechanisms are a building block for theories that incorporate other trade-offs faced by plants, such as those between competitive ability and dispersal.
* 4Numerous plant traits interactively determine R* in a manner predictable from trait-based resource competition theory. The same traits shown by comparative research to be associated with plant dominance in low-nutrient habitats give lower R* values, greater predicted competitive ability and greater predicted abundances in nutrient-limited habitats.
* 5Plant ecology needs closer links between analytical theory, observations and experiments. Simple verbal theories can generate novel ideas but the logical implications of such scenarios are best explored using the rigorous logic of mathematics.

	abstract = {A humped-back relationship between species richness and community biomass has frequently been observed in plant communities, at both local and regional scales, although often improperly called a productivity–diversity relationship. Explanations for this relationship have emphasized the role of competitive exclusion, probably because at the time when the relationship was first examined, competition was considered to be the significant biotic filter structuring plant communities. However, over the last 15 years there has been a renewed interest in facilitation and this research has shown a clear link between the role of facilitation in structuring communities and both community biomass and the severity of the environment. Although facilitation may enlarge the realized niche of species and increase community richness in stressful environments, there has only been one previous attempt to revisit the humped-back model of species richness and to include facilitative processes. However, to date, no model has explored whether biotic interactions can potentially shape both sides of the humped-back model for species richness commonly detected in plant communities. Here, we propose a revision of Grime's original model that incorporates a new understanding of the role of facilitative interactions in plant communities. In this revised model, facilitation promotes diversity at medium to high environmental severity levels, by expanding the realized niche of stress-intolerant competitive species into harsh physical conditions. However, when environmental conditions become extremely severe the positive effects of the benefactors wane (as supported by recent research on facilitative interactions in extremely severe environments) and diversity is reduced. Conversely, with decreasing stress along the biomass gradient, facilitation decreases because stress-intolerant species become able to exist away from the canopy of the stress-tolerant species (as proposed by facilitation theory). At the same time competition increases for stress-tolerant species, reducing diversity in the most benign conditions (as proposed by models of competition theory). In this way our inclusion of facilitation into the classic model of plant species diversity and community biomass generates a more powerful and richer predictive framework for understanding the role of plant interactions in changing diversity. We then use our revised model to explain both the observed discrepancies between natural patterns of species richness and community biomass and the results of experimental studies of the impact of biodiversity on the productivity of herbaceous communities. It is clear that explicit consideration of concurrent changes in stress-tolerant and competitive species enhances our capacity to explain and interpret patterns in plant community diversity with respect to environmental severity.},

	abstract = {The relative impacts of nutrient availability, disturbance intensity, and interspecific competition on species distribution and growth were studied by applying five levels of nutrients and five intensities of clipping to simple artificial communities (of Dactylis glomerata, Holcus lanatus, Lolium perenne, and Trifolium repens) in a factorial design for 16 mo. This was done to test the hypothesis that the effects of interspecific competition would decline along gradients as the amount of nutrients decreased and the degree of disturbance increased. Nutrients and disturbance, alone and in interaction, produced significant effects on percent cover of all species, and all species achieved maximum percent cover in the undisturbed regime. The experimental design permitted us to distinguish between percent cover reductions caused directly by nutrients and disturbance from those caused by interspecific competition. When grown in mixture, interspecific competition produced marked changes in the distribution patterns of percent cover that were in addition to the direct impacts of nutrients and disturbance. The absolute reduction in percent cover due to interspecific competition was greatest in the undisturbed regime, and for many mixtures this competitive effect was significantly reduced or even eliminated in the highly disturbed areas. Along the nutrient gradient the responses were variable and neighbor dependent, but for all species, the absolute reduction in percent cover due to interspecific competition was generally most severe where percent cover in pure stands was highest. When the data were standardized for differences in percent cover in pure stands and competition was assessed as the percent reduction in percent cover between pure and mixed stands, then the effect of interspecific competition on Trifolium declined along both gradients. The three grasses had a reasonably constant competitive effect across the disturbance gradient, but along the nutrient gradient the highest competitive effects were generally achieved where percent cover in pure stands was highest. We argue that this standardized index is less appropriate because it obscures the obvious differences in interspecific competition effects that are clearly operating within these communities.},

First, results are reviewed from recent research on vegetation change, land degradation and desertification. The role of disturbances and low recurrence events in triggering non-linear changes by driving ecosystems beyond their resilience thresholds is outlined. Particular attention is paid to the development of spatial structures as feedbacks that tend to buffer degradation. Secondly, the synergetic operation of climatic and anthropogenic forcing factors of dryland degradation is discussed in the light of some case histories. Changes in one group of those factors often render the ecosystems particularly sensitive to changes of those in the second group. Thirdly, off-site effects of dryland degradation are summarized, including feedbacks to the atmosphere, changes in biological diversity and downstream impacts in river catchments. Finally, the implications of global change for land degradation control policies are outlined. The importance of prevention is emphasized, as well as the need to carefully consider where to apply rehabilitation and restoration. Prevention includes soft and cheap measures based on management practices, while restoration calls for massive and expensive interventions on soil or vegetation. (C) 1998 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

The competitive strategy prevails in productive, relatively undisturbed vegetation, the stress-tolerant strategy is associated with continuously unproductive conditions, and the ruderal strategy is characteristic of severely disturbed but potentially productive habitats. A triangular model based upon the three strategies may be reconciled with the theory of r- and K-selection, provides an insight into the processes of vegetation succession and dominance, and appears to be capable of extension to fungi and to animals.},

Nature is usually assumed to respond to gradual change in a smooth way. However, studies on lakes, coral reefs, oceans, forests and arid lands have shown that smooth change can be interrupted by sudden drastic switches to a contrasting state. Although diverse events can trigger such shifts, recent studies show that a loss of resilience usually paves the way for a switch to an alternative state. This suggests that strategies for sustainable management of such ecosystems should focus on maintaining resilience.},

	abstract = {* Facilitation by nurse plants is a key process involved in the organization of plant communities and maintenance of biodiversity, particularly in harsh environments. Nurse plants increase plant diversity and productivity in these ecosystems, but our knowledge on the mechanisms through which such facilitation operates is still expanding. * Despite growing evidence that soil microbiota impact plant fitness and community dynamics, their role in plant facilitation has been little explored. Here, we synthesize available evidence on the effect of nurse plants on the abundance, composition and activity of soil microbial communities, and the effect of these soil communities on beneficiary plant species. * Studies conducted mostly in arid and semi-arid systems show that nurse plants promote the development of differentiated soil microbial communities characterized by a higher microbial abundance and activity, the dominance of competitive bacteria and larger mycorrhizal networks, compared to gaps and to coexisting non-nurses. There is also evidence that differentiated soil microbiota associated with nurse plants has positive effects on the establishment, growth and fitness of beneficiary plant species, although the mechanisms involved remain unclear. We suggest that they include increased nutrient availability for plants, a better use of resources through functional complementarity in the microbial community, soil stabilization and also direct molecular signalling between soil microbes and plants that affect plant defence and plant interactions. * Evidence for the role of soil microbiota as mediators of facilitation by nurse plants is growing, but there are still too few studies on which to draw generalizable conclusions. Future studies are needed to assess the effect of plant ontogeny and environmental conditions on soil microbial communities under nurse plants and other coexisting species, and to determine the microbial groups and specific mechanisms involved in facilitation by nurse plants.},

	abstract = {* Body condition indices, measures of body ‘plumpness’ or mass relative to frame size, are often used as a proxy for lipid reserves or fitness-related traits of animals and assumed to be positively related to fitness. * The quantification and analysis of body condition indices has been the subject of debate for decades. Here, we summarize three additional concerns with the use of body condition indices. * First, body condition index is often poorly correlated with lipid content in animals. Second, even if body condition index and lipid content are correlated, lipid content of an animal may not be the most important aspect of body composition influencing fitness. Finally, neither body condition index nor lipid reserves are likely to be directly positively related to fitness in animals, as many animals homeostatically regulate intermediate levels of condition index or lipid reserves, with both higher and lower values incurring fitness costs. * A wide range of analytical methods, including some relatively inexpensive and simple measures, are available for more detailed measures of animal body composition or fitness-related traits. Replacing body condition indices with more direct measures of body composition – even relatively simple measures – can inform understanding of the physiological mechanisms underlying animal responses in a wide range of behavioural, ecological and evolutionary studies.},

	abstract = {* Experimental glucocorticoid (GC) manipulations can be useful for identifying the mechanisms that drive life-history and fitness variation in free-living animals, but predicting the effects of GC treatment can be complicated. Much of the uncertainty stems from the multi-faceted role of GCs in organismal metabolism, and their variable influence with respect to life-history stage, ecological context, age, sex and individual variation. * Glucocorticoid hormones have been implicated in the regulation of parental care in many vertebrate taxa but in two seemingly contradictory ways, which sets up a potential GC-induced ‘reproductive conflict’. Circulating GCs mediate adaptive physiological and behavioural responses to stressful events, and elevated levels can lead to trade offs between reproductive effort and survival (e.g. the current reproduction vs. survival hypothesis). The majority of studies examining the fitness effects of GC manipulations extend from this hypothesis. However, when animals are not stressed (likely most of the time) baseline GCs act as key metabolic regulators of daily energy balance, homoeostasis, osmoregulation and food acquisition, with pleiotropic effects on locomotor activity or foraging behaviour. Slight increases in circulating baseline levels can then have positive effects on reproductive effort (e.g. the ‘cort’ fitness/adaptation hypotheses), but comparatively few GC manipulation studies have targeted these small, non-stress induced increases. * We review studies of GC manipulations and examine the specific hypotheses used to predict the effects of manipulations in wild, breeding vertebrates. We argue that given the dichotomous function of GCs the current ‘reproduction vs. survival’ paradigm is unnecessarily restrictive and predicts only deleterious GC effects on fitness. Therefore, a broader set of hypotheses should be considered when testing the fitness effects of GC manipulations. * When framing experimental manipulation studies, we urge researchers to consider three key points: life-history context (e.g. long vs. short lived, semelparous vs. iteroparous, etc.), ecological context and dose delivery.},

	abstract = {* There is a widespread perception in the academic community that peer review is subject to many biases and can be influenced by the identity and biographic features (such as gender) of manuscript authors. * We examined how patterns of authorship differ between men and women, and whether author gender influences editorial and peer review outcomes and/or the peer review process for papers submitted to the journal Functional Ecology between 2010 and 2014. * Women represented approximately a third of all authors on papers submitted to Functional Ecology. Relative to overall frequency of authorship, women were underrepresented as solo authors (26\% were women). On multi-authored papers, women were also underrepresented as last/senior authors (25\% were women) but overrepresented as first authors (43\% were women). Women first authors were less likely than men first authors to serve as corresponding and submitting author of their papers; this difference was not influenced by the gender of the last author. Women were more likely to be authors on papers if the last author was female. * Papers with female authors (i) were equally likely to be sent for peer review, (ii) obtained equivalent peer review scores and (iii) were equally likely to be accepted for publication, compared to papers with male authors. There was no evidence that male editors or male reviewers treated papers authored by women differently than did female editors and reviewers, and no evidence that more senior editors reached different decisions than younger editors after review, or cumulative through the entire process, for papers authored by men vs. women. * Papers authored by women were more likely to be reviewed by women. This is primarily because women were more likely to be invited to review if the authors on a paper were female than if the authors were male. * Patterns of authorship, and the role undertaken as author (e.g., submitting and serving as corresponding author), differ notably between men and women for papers submitted to Functional Ecology. However, consistent with a growing body of literature indicating that peer review underlying the scholarly publishing process is largely gender-neutral, outcomes of editorial and peer review at Functional Ecology were not influenced by author gender.},

The gender ratio of selected reviewers was also highly majority male, but the proportion of women selected as reviewers increased over the 10 years largely because the number of women on the editorial board increased and female editors invited more female reviewers than did male editors. Male editors selected {\textless}25\% female reviewers even in the year they selected the most women, but female editors consistently selected ˜30–35\% female reviewers. Editors also over-selected reviewers from their own geographic locality. * Women invited to review were less likely to respond to review invitations, but more likely to accept if they responded. Women invited to review responded to the invitation similarly regardless of whether the editor inviting them was male or female, but men invited to review were both less likely to respond and more likely to decline if the editor was female. * Review scores given to papers did not differ between male and female reviewers, and final decisions (proportion of papers rejected) did not differ between male and female editors. * The proportion of women among selected reviewers decreased with editor seniority when the editor was male but increased with editor seniority when the editor was female. Thus, the gender ratio of selected reviewers differed little between early-career male and female editors but differed a lot between late-career (more senior) male and female editors. Individuals invited to review were less likely to agree to review if the editor was more senior. * Editor gender, seniority and geographic location affect who is invited to review for Functional Ecology, and how invitees respond to review invitations, but not the final outcome of the peer review process.

	abstract = {Tradeoffs between plant growth and defense are central to theoretical frameworks used to study the ecology and evolution of plant defense against herbivores. However, these frameworks, as well as the experiments designed to test them, rarely include belowground herbivores. We experimentally challenged seedlings of the tropical shrub Solanum lycocarpum (Solanaceae) with either aboveground foliar herbivores (Spodoptera caterpillars) or belowground root herbivores (the nematode Meloidogyne incognita) and measured the resulting changes in plant growth rates, biomass allocation, and the concentration of defensive terpenoids in roots and leaves. We found that plants that suffered aboveground herbivory responded with aboveground growth but belowground defense. Similarly, belowground herbivory resulted in root growth but elevated defenses of leaves. These results underscore the importance of belowground plant-herbivore interactions, and suggest that – in contrast to theoretical predictions – plants can simultaneously invest in both growth and defense. Finally, they emphasize the need for a ‘whole-plant’ perspective in theoretical and empirical evaluations of plant-herbivore interactions. This article is protected by copyright.

A different approach to problems of multiple significance testing is presented. It calls for controlling the expected proportion of falsely rejected hypotheses-the false discovery rate. This error rate is equivalent to the FWER when all hypotheses are true but is smaller otherwise. Therefore, in problems where the control of the false discovery rate rather than that of the FWER is desired, there is potential for a gain in power. A simple sequential Bonferroni-type procedure is proved to control the false discovery rate for independent test statistics, and a simulation study shows that the gain in power is substantial. The use of the new procedure and the appropriateness of the criterion are illustrated with examples.},

	volume = {25},
	issn = {00664162},
	url = {http://www.jstor.org/stable/2097320},
	abstract = {Indirect effects occur when the impact of one species on another requires the presence of a third species. They can arise in two general ways: through linked chains of direct interactions, and when a species changes the interactions among species. Indirect effects have been uncovered largely by experimental studies that have monitored the response of many species and discovered "unexpected results," although some studies have looked for specific indirect effects predicted from simple models. The characteristics of such approaches make it likely that the many indirect effects remain uncovered, but the application of techniques such as path analysis may reduce this problem. Deterministic theory indicates that indirect effects should often be important, although stochastic models need exploration. Simulation models indicate that some indirect effects may stabilize multi-species assemblages. Five simple types of indirect effects have been regularly demonstrated in nature: exploitative competition, trophic cascades, apparent competition, indirect mutualism, and interaction modifications. Detailed experimental investigations of natural communities have yielded complicated effects. Indirect effects have the potential to affect evolutionary patterns, but empirical examples are limited. Future directions in the study of indirect effects include developing techniques to estimate interaction strength in dynamic models, deriving more efficient approaches to detecting indirect effects, evaluating the effectiveness of approaches such as path analysis, and investigating mechanisms in which a species changes how other species interact.},

It offers reliable, hands-on coverage of the bootstrap's considerable advantages -- as well as its drawbacks. The book outpaces the competition by skillfully presenting results on improved confidence set estimation, estimation of error rates in discriminant analysis, and applications to a wide variety of hypothesis testing and estimation problems. To alert readers to the limitations of the method, the book exhibits counterexamples to the consistency of bootstrap methods. The authors take great care to draw connections between the more traditional resampling methods and the bootstrap, oftentimes displaying helpful computer routines in R. Emphasis throughout the book is on the use of the bootstrap as an exploratory tool including its value in variable selection and other modeling environments"--},

	abstract = {Plant diversity has been shown to increase community biomass in experimental communities, but the mechanisms resulting in such positive biodiversity effects have remained largely unknown. We used a large-scale six-year biodiversity experiment near Jena, Germany, to examine how aboveground community biomass in grasslands is affected by different components of plant diversity and thereby infer the mechanisms that may underlie positive biodiversity effects. As components of diversity we defined the number of species (1–16), number of functional groups (1–4), presence of functional groups (legumes, tall herbs, small herbs, and grasses) and proportional abundance of functional groups. Using linear models, replacement series on the level of functional groups, and additive partitioning on the level of species, we explored whether the observed biodiversity effects originated from disproportionate effects of single functional groups or species or from positive interactions between them. Aboveground community biomass was positively related to the number of species measured across functional groups as well as to the number of functional groups measured across different levels of species richness. Furthermore, increasing the number of species within functional groups increased aboveground community biomass, indicating that species within functional groups were not redundant with respect to biomass production. A positive relationship between the number of functional groups and aboveground community biomass within a particular level of species richness suggested that complementarity was larger between species belonging to different rather than to the same functional groups. The presence of legumes or tall herbs had a strong positive impact on aboveground community biomass whereas the presence of small herbs or grasses had on average no significant effect. Two- and three-way interactions between functional group presences were weak, suggesting that their main effects were largely additive. Replacement series analyses on the level of functional groups revealed strong transgressive overyielding and relative yields {\textgreater}1, indicating facilitation. On the species level, we found strong complementarity effects that increased over time while selection effects due to disproportionate contributions of particular species decreased over time. We conclude that transgressive overyielding between functional groups and species richness effects within functional groups caused the positive biodiversity effects on aboveground community biomass in our experiment.},

	abstract = {* How species coexist is a central question in ecology. Niche differentiation can prevent two species from excluding each other by competition. However, this interaction can vary in space because of internal factors such as intraspecific genetic variation, or external ones such as the presence of a third species. While these effects have been repeatedly observed, their joint effect on the outcome of competition has rarely been considered.


* We experimentally investigated how a dominant ecosystem engineer (the shrub Thymus vulgaris) affects interactions between two co-occurring and closely related annuals (Medicago minima and M. rigidula). We ask first whether the outcome of their interaction depends on the genetic identity of the competitors, and in particular whether intraspecific interaction differs between genetically related versus unrelated conspecifics. Secondly, we ask whether coexistence of the two species is modified by the presence of thyme plants altering local soil conditions.


* We grew genotypes collected in nature of both annual species in inter- and intraspecific competition experiments using soil collected directly underneath thyme plant (thyme soil) and soil collected away from thyme plants (no-thyme soil).


* We found that thyme soil affected interactions in a way that shifted the species’ rank. Crucial for this result was the division of intraspecific competition between genetically related and unrelated individuals. Intraspecific competition was significantly less detrimental to kin than to unrelated conspecifics. In highly structured plant populations, such effects could favour local dominance of a patch by one species. However, this kin effect occurred for each species only in its preferred soil (thyme vs. no thyme), promoting a stabilizing coexistence mechanism at the landscape level.


* Synthesis. This study shows that the importance of intraspecific competition relative to interspecific competition can be highly dependent on the genotype identity of intraspecific competitors and of the local environment in which the interaction occurs. The local environment can itself be modified by the presence of a third species in the community. These results emphasize how, in order to understand the overall problem of species coexistence, it can be insightful to divide this into smaller local-scale problems of coexistence.},

Unfortunately, these ideas are not relevant to many experiments, and so we develop an appropriate resource competition model and use this to explore the effects of habitat productivity on the intensity of competition. Several mechanisms influencing the productivity–competition intensity relationship are identified, and these mechanisms explored using two classic data sets. In both cases, there is good agreement between the model predictions and empirical patterns. Quantification of the mechanisms identified by the models will allow the development of a simple predictive theory linking measures of the intensity of competition with ecosystem-level properties.},

* R is convenient and (relatively) easy to learn, AD Model Builder is fast and robust but comes with a steep learning curve, while BUGS provides the greatest flexibility at the price of speed.


* Our model-fitting suggestions range from general cultural advice (where possible, use the tools and models that are most common in your subfield) to specific suggestions about how to change the mathematical description of models to make them more amenable to parameter estimation.


* A companion web site (https://groups.nceas.ucsb.edu/non-linear-modeling/projects) presents detailed examples of application of the three tools to a variety of typical ecological estimation problems; each example links both to a detailed project report and to full source code and data.},

Many different techniques have been used to estimate biomass for ecological, agricultural and forestry research. The most suitable technique depends on available budget, accuracy required, structure and composition of the vegetation, and whether species and component biomass are required. A survey of the methods that have been used to estimate biomass is given, and the advantages and disadvantages of direct sampling, calibrated visual estimation and double sampling techniques are discussed. The relative cost and accuracy of each technique are summarized and recommendations are made for the use of the techniques in different vegetation complexes, such as discrete shrubs or trees, patchy vegetation, homogeneous vegetation, and species-rich inhomogeneous heathland.},

	abstract = {Intransitive competition is often projected to be a widespread mechanism of species coexistence in ecological communities. However, it is unknown how much of the coexistence we observe in nature results from this mechanism when species interactions are also stabilized by pairwise niche differences. We combined field-parameterized models of competition among 18 annual plant species with tools from network theory to quantify the prevalence of intransitive competitive relationships. We then analyzed the predicted outcome of competitive interactions with and without pairwise niche differences. Intransitive competition was found for just 15–19\% of the 816 possible triplets, and this mechanism was never sufficient to stabilize the coexistence of the triplet when the pair-wise niche differences between competitors were removed. Of the transitive and intransitive triplets, only four were predicted to coexist and these were more similar in multidimensional trait space defined by 11 functional traits than non-coexisting triplets. Our results argue that intransitive competition may be less frequent than recently posed, and that even when it does operate, pairwise niche differences may be key to possible coexistence.},

Using his competition model, Volterra (1927) proved this result mathematically for the case of one resource. Experimental verification was supplied by the work of Gause (1934) with Paramecium caudatum and Paramecium aurelia, as well as by Park’s work with the flour beetle. Later MacArthur and Levins (1964) argued that the result extends to more than one resource. Independently Rescigno and Richardson (1965) gave a mathematical proof of the exclusion principle for a model more general than Volterra’s, allowing any number of resources, or as they call them, niches. Levin (1970) simplified their proof a little and observed that the niches did not have to be resources — he called them limiting factors. From this the general form of the principle follows: If n species coexist, then they must be limited by at least n independent limiting factors.},

Here we show that increasing the species diversity of a functional group of aquatic organisms induces facilitative interactions, leading to non-additive changes in resource consumption. We increased the richness and evenness of suspension-feeding caddisfly larvae (Insecta, Trichoptera) in stream mesocosms and found that the increased topographical complexity of the benthic habitat alters patterns of near-bed flow such that the feeding success of individuals is enhanced. Species diversity reduces 'current shading' (that is, the deceleration of flow from upstream to downstream neighbours), allowing diverse assemblages to capture a greater fraction of suspended resources than is caught by any species monoculture. The fundamental nature of this form of hydrodynamic facilitation suggests that it is broadly applicable to freshwater and marine habitats; in addition, it has several analogues in terrestrial ecosystems where fluxes of energy and matter can be influenced by biophysical complexity. Thus, changes in species diversity may alter the probability of positive species interactions, resulting in disproportionately large changes in the functioning of ecosystems.},

	abstract = {Although the effects of variation between individuals within species are traditionally ignored in studies of species coexistence, the magnitude of intraspecific variation in nature is forcing ecologists to reconsider. Compelling intuitive arguments suggest that individual variation may provide a previously unrecognised route to diversity maintenance by blurring species-level competitive differences or substituting for species-level niche differences. These arguments, which are motivating a large body of empirical work, have rarely been evaluated with quantitative theory. Here we incorporate intraspecific variation into a common model of competition and identify three pathways by which this variation affects coexistence: (1) changes in competitive dynamics because of nonlinear averaging, (2) changes in species’ mean interaction strengths because of variation in underlying traits (also via nonlinear averaging) and (3) effects on stochastic demography. As a consequence of the first two mechanisms, we find that intraspecific variation in competitive ability increases the dominance of superior competitors, and intraspecific niche variation reduces species-level niche differentiation, both of which make coexistence more difficult. In addition, individual variation can exacerbate the effects of demographic stochasticity, and this further destabilises coexistence. Our work provides a theoretical foundation for emerging empirical interests in the effects of intraspecific variation on species diversity.},

	abstract = {A proposed refinement to the stress-gradient hypothesis requires consideration of the strategies of the interacting species and the characteristics of the stress factors. While the strength and direction of these interactions can be predicted for different ecosystems, this idea remains largely untested in the field. We performed a manipulative field experiment complemented with a descriptive study to test the predictions in a natural setting that represents the extreme end of a precipitation gradient. There, wind driven desiccation and water availability are the main stressors (non-resource and resource-based stresses, respectively). We evaluated the interaction between the shrub and grasses that are dominant in the Patagonian steppe. The species had differences in morpho-functional traits and drought tolerance that fit into the C–S axis of Grime's strategies. We experimentally separated root zones to limit direct competition for soil moisture and reduce the resource-based stress on grasses. We also manipulated the distance to shrubs to evaluate non-resource stress amelioration by canopies (e.g., sun and wind) on grasses. Finally, we evaluated the distribution of naturally established C and S grasses in the neighborhood of C and S shrubs to infer process-pattern relationships. Our growth data coincide to a large degree to the predictions. We found positive effects on the growth of beneficiaries when stress was non-resource based and when strategies differed (i.e., Cshrub–Sgrass and Sshrub–Cgrass). We also found strong negative effects when the abiotic stress was driven by water, particularly on C grasses. Additionally, shrubs only increased the survival of grasses when strategies differed (i.e., Cshrub–Sgrass and Sshrub–Cgrass). Our manipulative and descriptive study supported previous results that showed that stress-tolerant species are important for the persistence of competitive species at high stress. While the applicability and generality of these predictions remains to be tested with more field experiments, some ecological factors, such as stress types and species traits, can explain much of the variation in how dominant shrubs and grasses interact in this extreme arid environment. Moreover, this framework could be extended to specifically test the importance of facilitation under different levels of stress.},

	abstract = {1 It is useful to distinguish between the immediate effects of species richness on ecosystems and those which become apparent on a longer time scale, described here as filter and founder effects. 2 Relationships between plant diversity and ecosystem properties can be explored by classifying component species into three categories – dominants, subordinates and transients. Dominants recur in particular vegetation types, are relatively large, exhibit coarse-grained foraging for resources and, as individual species, make a substantial contribution to the plant biomass. Subordinates also show high fidelity of association with particular vegetation types but they are smaller in stature, forage on a more restricted scale and tend to occupy microhabitats delimited by the architecture and phenology of their associated dominants. Transients comprise a heterogeneous assortment of species of low abundance and persistence; a high proportion are juveniles of species that occur as dominants or subordinates in neighbouring ecosystems. 3 A ‘mass ratio’ theory proposes that immediate controls are in proportion to inputs to primary production, are determined to an overwhelming extent by the traits and functional diversity of the dominant plants and are relatively insensitive to the richness of subordinates and transients. Recent experiments support the mass ratio hypothesis and the conclusion of Huston (1997) that claims of immediate benefits of high species richness to ecosystem functions arise from misinterpretation of data. 4 Attribution of immediate control to dominants does not exclude subordinates and transients from involvement in the determination of ecosystem function and sustainability. Both are suspected to play a crucial, if intermittent, role by influencing the recruitment of dominants. Some subordinates may act as a filter influencing regeneration by dominants following major perturbations. 5 Transients originate from the seed rain and seed banks and provide an index of the pool of potential dominants and subordinates at specific sites. Where the landscape carousel operates against a background of declining diversity in the reservoir of colonizing transients, we may predict that a progressive loss of ecosystem functions will arise from the decline in the precision with which dominants can engage in the re-assembly and relocation of ecosystems.},

In sessile marine invertebrates, this trade-off can manifest as trends in species distributions relative to the size of isolated patches of substrate. Based on their abilities to find available substrate and competitively exclude neighbours, good colonisers tend to dominate smaller patches, whereas better competitors tend to monopolise larger patches. In theory, species with equivalent colonising and competitive abilities should display similar distributions across patch sizes. We used patch size to observe this manifestation of the competition-colonisation trade-off over 20° of latitude. The trade-off was more readily observed at lower latitudes and was proportional to the ‘ecological age’ of communities (i.e. the degree of resource acquisition and likelihood of species interactions). Results suggest that ecological age may mediate the prominence of stochastic or deterministic coexistence mechanisms and will depend on the rate of ecological processes.},

To formulate guidelines for land reclamation programmes, we exploredthe effects of artificial shading, irrigation, and removal of weed competitionon the performance of Retama sphaerocarpa (L.) Boiss.seedlings in a factorial experiment located in an abandoned cropland in CentralSpain. R. sphaerocarpa is of interest for revegetationbecause it is a drought tolerant leguminous shrub that is a major structuralcomponent of the native plant community. Seedling performance was evaluated inthree ways: seedling survivorship, growth, and photochemical efficiency. Wealsomeasured soil moisture and weed biomass production and found that bothincreasedunder artificial shading conditions. Soil moisture increased very slightlywhereweeds were removed. Thus, increased transpiration from weeds outweighed reducedevaporation from soils due to shading by weeds. Artificial shading was the mosteffective treatment for seedling survivorship, followed by removal ofcompetition by weeds. After summer, 34 \% of the seedlings survived in the mostfavourable conditions (artificially shaded plots where weeds were removed),compared to ca. 1 \% in full-light plots with no removal of weed competition. Apositive effect of irrigation was found for growth of seedling cover and heightin shaded plots. The analysis of photochemical efficiency pointed out therelevance of weed competition removal, and confirmed the usefulness of fastfluorescence transient techniques for the quantification of seedlingperformance. The data suggest that competition between seedlings and weeds wasprimarily for water rather than for light. We conclude that i) artificialshading improved seedling performance, but this is a little practical techniquebecause of its cost; ii) as weeds compete with, rather than facilitate, plantedseedlings, weed clipping around the seedlings is a feasible technique thatwouldimprove seedling survival; and iii) seedling performance could alsoconsiderablyimprove with a higher irrigation than was used in this experiment(75lm−2 per growth period), provided that weedsare removed.},

	abstract = {1. Transplant experiments with adult plants showed that marsh plant zonation along estuarine salinity gradients develops according to species tolerances of abiotic factors and biotic interactions. Thus, glycophytes are restricted from salt marshes by abiotic stress, whereas halophytes are excluded from freshwater marshes by competition. We hypothesized that adult plant zonations along estuarine stress gradients are predefined by processes affecting plants during their seedling phase. In an experimental glasshouse study, we tested how a mixed community of glycophytes and halophytes developed during the first months of early establishment affected by different flooding and salinity regimes. 2. We set up two factorial mesocosm experiments that tested the effects of three tidal regimes (daily tide, spring tide, no tide) and three salinity levels (fresh, brackish, salt) on the emergence and early establishment of glycophyte and halophyte seedlings. In the Emergence Experiment seedlings were identified and removed once per week. In the Establishment Experiment species cover was estimated every 2 weeks, and after 15 weeks final above-ground biomass of each species was determined. 3. Both glycophytes and halophytes showed highest seedling emergence under freshwater conditions. Emergence of halophytes was less impaired by increased salinities than that of glycophytes. Emergence and establishment of glycophytes were extremely reduced under brackish and salt conditions, whereas under freshwater conditions, glycophytes showed a consistent increase in cover over time. Cover of halophytes showed a similar increase in brackish and salt treatments; however, in freshwater treatments it significantly decreased after week 9. While daily tides predominantly decreased seedling emergence and establishment, spring tides had no significant effects on seedlings in freshwater and negative effects in saltwater treatments. 4. Synthesis. The ability of a species to germinate and emerge under conditions representing a particular position along an environmental gradient is necessary but not solely responsible for determining plant zonation patterns along estuarine marsh gradients. Our results show that competitive exclusion of halophytes by glycophytes as an important driver of marsh plant zonations along estuarine salinity gradients takes effect already during the early seedling establishment phase of the co-occurring plants.},

	abstract = {* Using trait-based approaches to study trophic interactions may represent one of the most promising approaches to evaluate the impact of trophic interactions on ecosystem functioning. To achieve this goal, it is necessary to clearly identify which traits determine the impact of one trophic level on another.


* Using functionally contrasting grasshopper species, we tested the ability of multiple traits (morphological, chemical and biomechanical) to predict herbivore impact on the biomass of a diverse plant community. We set-up a cage experiment in an old species rich grassland field and evaluated how multiple candidate grasshopper effect traits mediated herbivore impact on plant biomass.


* Grasshoppers had different impact on plant community biomass (consuming up to 60\% of plant community biomass). Grasshopper impact was positively correlated with their incisive strength while body size or grasshopper C:N ratio exhibited low predictive ability. Importantly, the strong relationship between the incisive strength and the impact was mediated by the grasshopper feeding niche, which was well predicted in our study by two simple plant traits (leaf dry matter content, leaf C:N ratio). Feeding niche differences between grasshoppers were explained by differences in incisive strength, highlighting the fundamental linkage between grasshopper effect traits and their niche.


* Our study contributes to the development of the trait-based approach in the study of trophic interactions by providing a first experimental test of the relationship between herbivore effect traits, their impact on plant community biomass, and in a larger extent on ecosystem functioning. By comparing the relative importance of multiple interacting grasshopper traits, our study showed that incisive strength was a key effect trait which determined grasshopper feeding niche and its relative impact on plant community biomass.},

	abstract = {1. Exotic plant species have become increasingly prominent features of ecological landscapes throughout the world, and their interactions with native and exotic taxa in these novel environments may play critical roles in mediating the dynamics of such invasions. 2. Here, we summarize results from comparative and experimental studies that explore the effects of two factors – herbivory and facilitation – on the performance and distribution of an invasive South African grass, Ehrharta calycina, in a coastal foredune system in northern California, USA. 3. Using a 2-year exclosure experiment, we show that a native herbivore, black-tailed jackrabbits (Lepus californicus), significantly reduced the height, shoot production, fecundity and above-ground biomass of this exotic grass. 4. Data from two comparative studies and a neighbour-removal experiment revealed that Ehrharta frequently escaped herbivores by associating with three neighbouring plant species – an exotic perennial grass, Ammophila arenaria, an exotic perennial succulent, Carpobrotus edulis, and a native perennial shrub, Baccharis pilularis. Ehrharta growing in association with neighbours was taller, had fewer grazed shoots, produced greater numbers of spikelets and had greater above-ground biomass than unassociated individuals. Furthermore, removing neighbours generally eliminated these benefits in 7 months, although effects differed among neighbour species. 5. An additional neighbour-removal experiment conducted in the absence of jackrabbits indicated that neighbour removals did not have significant impacts on Ehrharta height, shoot production, spikelet production or above-ground dry biomass. These results suggest that the primary means by which Ehrharta benefits from neighbouring plants is protection from herbivores – either because they are less apparent to herbivores or less accessible – and that Ehrharta likely incurred minimal costs from associating with neighbours. 6. Ehrharta was more frequently associated with neighbours than expected due to chance, and less frequently found in open dune habitat. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the effects of herbivory and facilitation have been sufficiently strong to shape the local distribution of this invader in the landscape. 7. Synthesis. Our research has demonstrated that herbivory and facilitation have jointly influenced the dynamics of a biological invasion, and highlights the importance of evaluating the effects of multiple interactions on invasions in a single system.},

	abstract = {1. Many studies of community assembly focus on two mechanisms: environmental filtering and competitive interactions. This focus ignores the importance of other assembly processes such as equalizing fitness processes and facilitation. The contribution of different processes to community assembly can be elucidated by examining functional diversity patterns of traits that differ in their contribution to different assembly processes. 2. In alpine tundra, we explored trait patterns along a stress–resource gradient that varied in productivity, nitrogen availability and soil moisture. We explore whether functional diversity is low in abiotic stressful environments and increases in more benign environments as competition becomes more important, and if equalizing fitness processes and facilitation affect functional diversity. We calculated community-weighted mean trait values and functional diversity for specific leaf area (SLA), leaf area, stomatal conductance, plant height and chlorophyll content as well as multivariate functional diversity and phylogenetic diversity. 3. At the community level, functional diversity increased at both ends of the gradient: high resource availability was associated with greater functional diversity in height and leaf area, and lower resource availability was associated with greater functional diversity in SLA, stomatal conductance, and chlorophyll content. As a result of this trade-off in functional diversity among traits, multivariate functional diversity did not change across the gradient. Phylogenetic diversity increased with increasing resource availability. 4. We find evidence for at least three assembly processes along the gradient. Abiotic filtering by wind and cold exposure may reduce functional diversity in height and leaf area at the low resource end of the gradient. Also at low resource availability, increasing functional diversity in the other three traits suggests competition for below-ground resources. At the resource-rich end of the gradient, increased functional diversity in height and leaf area suggests increased competition for light or facilitation. 5.Synthesis: Our results suggest that multiple assembly processes (abiotic filtering, above-ground competition, and below-ground competition) operate simultaneously to structure plant communities along a stress–resource gradient. These processes would be obscured by a single multivariate trait index or phylogenetic diversity and are only evident by analysing functional diversity patterns of individual traits.},

In plant communities, the presence of a species has consequences for other species, with some being competitively excluded while others benefit from the close vicinity of neighbours. Even though such specificity in plant interactions is common and known, there is no empirical assessment of the mechanisms that would help us understand its importance for plant diversity. Here we asked whether analysing spatial associations between plant traits known to affect the environment (i.e. effect traits) and those known to respond to the environment (i.e. response traits) might explain plant–plant interactions and their role in community assembly.


Location

Sierra Nevada Mountains, Spain.


Methods

In a field study, we addressed the specificity of plant–plant interactions by quantifying effect traits of three co-occurring cushion-forming species and response traits of their associated plant assemblages. Traits were measured at the individual level and then aggregated to trait metrics (mean, range, dispersion) at the plot level. Finally, plot-level metrics of effect traits were related to response traits and the species composition of plant communities.


Results

Each cushion-forming species had a distinctive combination of effect traits and harboured a unique plant community with an exclusive composition of response traits. With multivariate statistics we showed that differences in effect traits (branch density and canopy height) among and within cushion species significantly explained response traits (specific leaf area, leaf dry matter content) of associated species and the local-scale species composition.


Conclusions

Using effect and response traits measured at the individual level, we provide a mechanistic understanding of the species specificity of plant interactions and demonstrate how important such specificity is for species diversity in an ecosystem.},

We investigated the extent to which biomechanical traits are related to consumption in a plant–grasshopper herbivory network.

* Using a choice experiment, we assessed the feeding patterns of 26 grasshopper species for 24 common plant species from subalpine grasslands. We quantified shear and punch toughness for each plant species, while grasshopper incisive and molar strengths were estimated by a lever mechanics model, following the measurement of mandibular traits.

* Models incorporating co-phylogenetic effects showed that the ratio between the grasshopper incisive strength and plant toughness, that reflects the cutting effort, is correlated with the mass of plant eaten. Moreover, a strong relationship between the incisive strength of the grasshoppers and the weighed mean toughness of the plants they eat was found.

* Our results suggest that biomechanical constraints imposed by plants influence the evolution of grasshoppers' mandibular traits. Such scaling relationships offer promising avenues towards the understanding of trait – function links in interaction networks.},

It simultaneously assesses the drivers of multifunctionality, such as species relative abundances, richness, evenness and other manipulated treatments. It also tests the relative importance of these drivers across functions, incorporates correlations among functions and identifies conditions where all functions perform well and where trade-offs occur among functions. We illustrate our framework using data from three ecosystem functions (sown biomass, weed suppression and nitrogen yield) in a four-species grassland experiment. We found high variability in performance across the functions in monocultures, but as community diversity increased, performance increased and variability across functions decreased.},

The competition-defence hypothesis posits a trade-off between competitive ability and defence against enemies (e.g. herbivores and pathogens). The growth-defence hypothesis suggests that strong competitors for nutrients are also defended against enemies, at a cost to growth rate. We tested these hypotheses using observations of 706 plant populations of over 500 species before and following identical fertilisation and fencing treatments at 39 grassland sites worldwide. Strong positive covariance in species responses to both treatments provided support for a growth-defence trade-off: populations that increased with the removal of nutrient limitation (poor competitors) also increased following removal of consumers. This result held globally across 4 years within plant life-history groups and within the majority of individual sites. Thus, a growth-defence trade-off appears to be the norm, and mechanisms maintaining grassland biodiversity may operate within this constraint.},

	abstract = {* The environmental filtering hypothesis predicts that the abiotic environment selects species with similar trait values within communities. Testing this hypothesis along multiple – and interacting – gradients of climate and soil variables constitutes a great opportunity to better understand and predict the responses of plant communities to ongoing environmental changes.


* Based on two key plant traits, maximum plant height and specific leaf area (SLA), we assessed the filtering effects of climate (mean annual temperature and precipitation, precipitation seasonality), soil characteristics (soil pH, sand content and total phosphorus) and all potential interactions on the functional structure and diversity of 124 dryland communities spread over the globe. The functional structure and diversity of dryland communities were quantified using the mean, variance, skewness and kurtosis of plant trait distributions.


* The models accurately explained the observed variations in functional trait diversity across the 124 communities studied. All models included interactions among factors, i.e. climate–climate (9\% of explanatory power), climate–soil (24\% of explanatory power) and soil–soil interactions (5\% of explanatory power). Precipitation seasonality was the main driver of maximum plant height, and interacted with mean annual temperature and precipitation. Soil pH mediated the filtering effects of climate and sand content on SLA. Our results also revealed that communities characterized by a low variance can also exhibit low kurtosis values, indicating that functionally contrasting species can co-occur even in communities with narrow ranges of trait values.


* Synthesis. We identified the particular set of conditions under which the environmental filtering hypothesis operates in drylands world-wide. Our findings also indicate that species with functionally contrasting strategies can still co-occur locally, even under prevailing environmental filtering. Interactions between sources of environmental stress should be therefore included in global trait-based studies, as this will help to further anticipate where the effects of environmental filtering will impact plant trait diversity under climate change.},

	abstract = {The focus of most ideas on diversity maintenance is species coexistence, which may be stable or unstable. Stable coexistence can be quantified by the long-term rates at which community members recover from low density. Quantification shows that coexistence mechanisms function in two major ways: They may be (a) equalizing because they tend to minimize average fitness differences between species, or (b) stabilizing because they tend to increase negative intraspecific interactions relative to negative interspecific interactions. Stabilizing mechanisms are essential for species coexistence and include traditional mechanisms such as resource partitioning and frequency-dependent predation, as well as mechanisms that depend on fluctuations in population densities and environmental factors in space and time. Equalizing mechanisms contribute to stable coexistence because they reduce large average fitness inequalities which might negate the effects of stabilizing mechanisms. Models of unstable coexitence, in which species diversity slowly decays over time, have focused almost exclusively on equalizing mechanisms. These models would be more robust if they also included stabilizing mechanisms, which arise in many and varied ways but need not be adequate for full stability of a system. Models of unstable coexistence invite a broader view of diversity maintenance incorporating species turnover.},

In a dry south and a wet north exposure we assessed short-term resource effects removing shrub canopy and long-term soil effects (including litter interference) with the comparison of forb performances in adjacent naturally open areas vs no shrub. Indirect effects were quantified through the removal of grasses. Abundance, richness and biomass of forbs were measured in all treatments after one year of experiment, together with litter depth and soil moisture. We found strong direct negative soil effects of the tight phenotype on all forb performances and in particular in south exposure. These effects were due to litter interference on water availability, but not to resource competition. They were likely explained by the high hydrophobicity of organic matter accumulating in the stressful habitat of the tight phenotype. We also found an indirect competition of the loose phenotype for forb richness, due to its direct positive soil effect on competitive grasses, and in particular in south exposure. Our results improve our knowledge on the importance of litter interference in dry nutrient-poor habitats and the role of indirect interactions in phenotypic effects on understorey species.},

Here we combine simple consumer-resource competition models and metacommunity theory with discussion of case studies to outline how spatial processes within metacommunities can alter community assembly and modify expectations about how species diversity and composition influence ecosystem attributes at local scales. We argue that when community assembly is strongly limited by dispersal, this can constrain ecosystem functioning by reducing positive selection effects (reducing the probability of the most productive species becoming dominant) even though it may often also enhance complementarity (favoring combinations of species that enhance production even though they may not individually be most productive). Conversely, excess dispersal with strong source-sink relations among heterogeneous habitats can reduce ecosystem functioning by swamping local filters that would normally favor better-suited species. Ecosystem function is thus most likely maximized at intermediate levels of dispersal where both of these effects are minimized. In this scenario, we find that the selection effect is maximized, while complementarity is often reduced and local diversity may often be relatively low. Our synthesis emphasizes that it is the entire set of community assembly processes that affect the functioning of ecosystems, not just the part that determines local species richness.},

Yet local recycling of materials from enriched ecosystems may affect the stability of connected ecosystems. Here we study the effect of nutrient, detritus, producer, and consumer spatial flows—combined with changes in regional enrichment—on the stability of a metaecosystem model. We considered both spatially homogeneous and heterogeneous enrichment. We found that nutrient and detritus spatial flows are destabilizing, whereas producer or consumer spatial flows are either neutral or stabilizing. We noticed that detritus spatial flows have only a weak impact on stability. Our study reveals that heterogeneity no longer stabilizes well-connected systems when accounting for explicit representation of nutrient dynamics. We also found that intermediate consumer diffusion could lead to multiple equilibria in strongly enriched metaecosystems. Stability can emerge from a top-down control allowing the storage of materials into inorganic form, a mechanism never documented before. In conclusion, local enrichment can be stabilized if spatial flows are strong enough to efficiently redistribute the local excess of enrichment to unfertile ecosystems. However, high regional enrichment can be dampened only by intermediate consumer diffusion rates.},

	abstract = {Plant traits – the morphological, anatomical, physiological, biochemical and phenological characteristics of plants and their organs – determine how primary producers respond to environmental factors, affect other trophic levels, influence ecosystem processes and services and provide a link from species richness to ecosystem functional diversity. Trait data thus represent the raw material for a wide range of research from evolutionary biology, community and functional ecology to biogeography. Here we present the global database initiative named TRY, which has united a wide range of the plant trait research community worldwide and gained an unprecedented buy-in of trait data: so far 93 trait databases have been contributed. The data repository currently contains almost three million trait entries for 69 000 out of the world's 300 000 plant species, with a focus on 52 groups of traits characterizing the vegetative and regeneration stages of the plant life cycle, including growth, dispersal, establishment and persistence. A first data analysis shows that most plant traits are approximately log-normally distributed, with widely differing ranges of variation across traits. Most trait variation is between species (interspecific), but significant intraspecific variation is also documented, up to 40\% of the overall variation. Plant functional types (PFTs), as commonly used in vegetation models, capture a substantial fraction of the observed variation – but for several traits most variation occurs within PFTs, up to 75\% of the overall variation. In the context of vegetation models these traits would better be represented by state variables rather than fixed parameter values. The improved availability of plant trait data in the unified global database is expected to support a paradigm shift from species to trait-based ecology, offer new opportunities for synthetic plant trait research and enable a more realistic and empirically grounded representation of terrestrial vegetation in Earth system models.},

	abstract = {* In facilitative interactions, the beneficiary feedback effect (BFE) has been defined as the effect of beneficiary species (facilitated species) on their benefactor. BFEs have been shown to be dependent on environmental conditions and the composition of the beneficiary community. In alpine cushion systems, BFEs are more negative with more abundant, diverse and phylogenetically aggregated communities of beneficiary species.


* We tested the hypothesis that the functional composition of the beneficiary communities correlates with the direction and strength of BFE received by alpine cushion benefactors and specifically that a more negative BFE would occur with increasing density of graminoids and a more positive BFE would occur with increasing density of forbs and legumes. Additionally, we predicted that the negative BFE of graminoids would increase with increasing summer aridity.


* We used a data base of alpine cushion communities from 30 sites throughout the world to assess the overall relationship between the composition of beneficiary communities and the total flower density of cushion benefactors, and its variation with increasing drought. Additionally, in order to assess more precisely the role of the functional composition of the beneficiary communities on BFE in a very dry site with cushion benefactors exhibiting contrasting functional compositions of beneficiary communities, we also designed a field study in the Qilian Shan mountain range (China). At this site with a highly continental climate, we compared the number of flowers and fruits of different phenotypes of the alpine cushion species Thylacospermum caespitosum hosting numerous graminoids, numerous forbs or very few beneficiary species.


* In the intercontinental study, we found a negative relationship between graminoids and cushion benefactor flower density but no effect of other functional groups. The negative BFE of graminoids increased with increasing summer drought. In the dry Qilian Shan range, we found both a negative effect of graminoids on total flower density and a positive effect of forbs on flower density and fruit set.


* Our study indicates that the context dependence of BFE may be partially explained by the composition of beneficiary communities and in particular the negative effect of graminoids.},

	abstract = {* 1Recent efforts to understand how the patterning of interaction strength affects both structure and dynamics in food webs have highlighted several obstacles to productive synthesis. Issues arise with respect to goals and driving questions, methods and approaches, and placing results in the context of broader ecological theory.
* 2Much confusion stems from lack of clarity about whether the questions posed relate to community-level patterns or to species dynamics, and to what authors actually mean by the term ‘interaction strength’. Here, we describe the various ways in which this term has been applied and discuss the implications of loose terminology and definition for the development of this field.
* 3Of particular concern is the clear gap between theoretical and empirical investigations of interaction strengths and food web dynamics. The ecological community urgently needs to explore new ways to estimate biologically reasonable model coefficients from empirical data, such as foraging rates, body size, metabolic rate, biomass distribution and other species traits.
* 4Combining numerical and analytical modelling approaches should allow exploration of the conditions under which different interaction strengths metrics are interchangeable with regard to relative magnitude, system responses, and species identity.
* 5Finally, the prime focus on predator–prey links in much of the research to date on interaction strengths in food webs has meant that the potential significance of non-trophic interactions, such as competition, facilitation and biotic disturbance, has been largely ignored by the food web community. Such interactions may be important dynamically and should be routinely included in future food web research programmes.},

	abstract = {* 1A fundamental goal of ecological network research is to understand how the complexity observed in nature can persist and how this affects ecosystem functioning. This is essential for us to be able to predict, and eventually mitigate, the consequences of increasing environmental perturbations such as habitat loss, climate change, and invasions of exotic species.
* 2Ecological networks can be subdivided into three broad types: ‘traditional’ food webs, mutualistic networks and host–parasitoid networks. There is a recent trend towards cross-comparisons among network types and also to take a more mechanistic, as opposed to phenomenological, perspective. For example, analysis of network configurations, such as compartments, allows us to explore the role of co-evolution in structuring mutualistic networks and host–parasitoid networks, and of body size in food webs.
* 3Research into ecological networks has recently undergone a renaissance, leading to the production of a new catalogue of evermore complete, taxonomically resolved, and quantitative data. Novel topological patterns have been unearthed and it is increasingly evident that it is the distribution of interaction strengths and the configuration of complexity, rather than just its magnitude, that governs network stability and structure.
* 4Another significant advance is the growing recognition of the importance of individual traits and behaviour: interactions, after all, occur between individuals. The new generation of high-quality networks is now enabling us to move away from describing networks based on species-averaged data and to start exploring patterns based on individuals. Such refinements will enable us to address more general ecological questions relating to foraging theory and the recent metabolic theory of ecology.
* 5We conclude by suggesting a number of ‘dead ends’ and ‘fruitful avenues’ for future research into ecological networks.},

Although the dynamic implications of compartmentalization have been debated for at least four decades, a general answer has remained elusive. Here, we unambiguously demonstrate that compartmentalization acts to increase the persistence of multitrophic food webs. We then identify the mechanisms behind this result. Compartments in food webs act directly to buffer the propagation of extinctions throughout the community and augment the long-term persistence of its constituent species. This contribution to persistence is greater the more complex the food web, which helps to reconcile the simultaneous complexity and stability of natural communities.},

There is almost no information on the structural organization of species-rich mutualistic networks despite its potential importance for the maintenance of diversity. Here we analyze 52 mutualistic networks and show that they are highly nested; that is, the more specialist species interact only with proper subsets of those species interacting with the more generalists. This assembly pattern generates highly asymmetrical interactions and organizes the community cohesively around a central core of interactions. Thus, mutualistic networks are neither randomly assembled nor organized in compartments arising from tight, parallel specialization. Furthermore, nestedness increases with the complexity (number of interactions) of the network: for a given number of species, communities with more interactions are significantly more nested. Our results indicate a nonrandom pattern of community organization that may be relevant for our understanding of the organization and persistence of biodiversity.},

	abstract = {Despite being a core ecological question, disentangling individual and interacting effects of plant-plant interactions, abiotic factors and species-specific adaptations as drivers of community assembly is challenging. Studies addressing this issue are growing rapidly, but they generally lack empirical data regarding species interactions and local abundances, or cover a narrow range of environmental conditions. We analysed species distribution models and local spatial patterns to isolate the relative importance of key abiotic (aridity) and biotic (facilitation and competition) drivers of plant community assembly in drylands worldwide. We examined the relative importance of these drivers along aridity gradients and used information derived from the niches of species to understand the role that species-specific adaptations to aridity play in modulating the importance of community assembly drivers. Facilitation, together with aridity, was the major driver of plant community assembly in global drylands. Due to community specialization, the importance of facilitation as an assembly driver decreased with aridity, and became non-significant at the border between arid and semiarid climates. Under the most arid conditions, competition affected species abundances in communities dominated by specialist species. Due to community specialization, the importance of aridity in shaping dryland plant communities peaked at moderate aridity levels. Synthesis: We showed that competition is an important driver of community assembly even under harsh environments, and that the effect of facilitation collapses as driver of species relative abundances under high aridity because of the specialization of the species pool to extremely dry conditions. Our findings pave the way to develop more robust species distribution models aiming to predict the consequences of ongoing climate change on community assembly in drylands, the largest biome on Earth.},

	abstract = {* Positive interactions among plants can increase species richness by relaxing environmental filters and providing more heterogeneous environments. However, it is not known if facilitation could affect coexistence through other mechanisms. Most studies on plant coexistence focus on negative frequency-dependent mechanisms (decreasing the abundance of common species); here, we test if facilitation can enhance coexistence by giving species an advantage when rare.


* To test our hypothesis, we used a global data set from drylands and alpine environments and measured the intensity of facilitation (based on co-occurrences with nurse plants) for 48 species present in at least 4 different sites and with a range of abundances in the field. We compared these results with the degree of facilitation experienced by species which are globally rare or common (according to the IUCN Red List), and with a larger data base including over 1200 co-occurrences of target species with their nurses.


* Facilitation was stronger for rare species (i.e. those having lower local abundances or considered endangered by the IUCN) than for common species, and strongly decreased with the abundance of the facilitated species. These results hold after accounting for the distance of each species from its ecological optimum (i.e. the degree of functional stress it experiences).


* Synthesis. Our results highlight that nurse plants not only increase the number of species able to colonize a given site, but may also promote species coexistence by preventing the local extinction of rare species. Our findings illustrate the role that nurse plants play in conserving endangered species and link the relationship between facilitation and diversity with coexistence theory. As such, they provide further mechanistic understanding on how facilitation maintains plant diversity.},

Vegetative growth took place during the cool season and the shrubs were leafless for c. 3 months during the dry season. In shrubs which had been supplied with water since late spring, leaf and shoot growth continued in the summer. Photosynthetic rate was limited by low plant water status for most of the observation period. Maximum photosynthetic rates of 14 μmol CO2m−2s−1were measured in early April but then declined progressively to practically zero in early July. Shrubs supplied with water maintained the same maximum photosynthetic rate in June. Superimposed on the environmentally controlled seasonal variation in the photosynthetic rate was a change in the leaf to stem area ratio as a result of leaf development, senescence (decrease in leaf nitrogen) and abscission. Anthyllis cytisoides is a drought avoider with a predictable, but temporally variable resting period. At various times of the seasonal cycle, the summer-deciduous habit allows only limited phenological and physiological responses to temporally favourable environmental conditions, which constrains carbon gain and productivity.},

	abstract = {Pinus halepensis has been extensively planted in semi-arid areas throughout the world. This has often led to slow-growth stands that: a) suffer from insect plagues, b) promote nutrient depletion and c) fail to promote the recovery of native vegetation. The introduction of native late-successional shrubs in these stands could stimulate successional processes, improve soil conditions and enhance their resilience against disturbances. The main objective of this study was to evaluate the mechanisms underlying the interaction between Pinus and the native late-successional shrub Pistacia lentiscus in a semi-arid plantation. By using manipulative field and laboratory experiments, we evaluated direct (competition for soil resources and allelopathic effects) and indirect (competition with herbaceous understorey) interactions between Pinus and Pistacia. We found no effect of Pinus litter and root exudates on Pistacia growth. In the field, Pistacia seedlings planted under the canopy of Pinus showed higher survival than those planted in open areas with sparse vegetation. Girdling of Pinus trees did not affect the performance of planted Pistacia seedlings, but suppression of the herbaceous understorey significantly enhanced both survival and physiological status of Pistacia seedlings planted under the canopy of Pinus. The magnitude of the interference by herbaceous understorey was considerably higher than that by Pinus. Our results provide evidence that a negative indirect interaction between Pinus and Pistacia, mediated by the herbaceous understorey, is taking place in the afforestation studied, and can help to explain the low rates of colonisation of late-successional woody shrubs typically observed in semi-arid Pinushalepensis plantations.},

	abstract = {Composition and structure of plant communities can be strongly influenced by plant interactions. Interactions among plants commonly comprise positive and negative effects operating simultaneously and bidirectionally. Thus, a thorough understanding of plant interactions requires experimental separation and quantitative assessment of the bidirectional positive and negative effects that add up to the net effects of plant interactions. Using the close spatial association of annual plants with a desert shrub (Ambrosia dumosa) in a sandy area of the Mojave Desert of California as a test system, we separated and quantified negative and positive effects of annuals on shrubs and of shrubs on annuals. We achieved the separation of negative and positive effects with an experimental design that included reciprocal removals of neighbors and simulations of physical effects of neighbors using artificial structures. All experimental manipulations were conducted on space originally occupied by Ambrosia shrubs to focus on immediate effects of neighbors on water availability rather than on long-term microenvironmental effects (e.g., nutrient accumulation). We quantified positive effects by calculating the difference between performance parameters of neighbors growing with artificial structures (thatch to mimic the physical effects of the presence of annuals and artificial canopies to mimic the physical effects of shrubs) and those of neighbors growing alone (removals). We estimated negative effects by calculating the difference between plant performance on control plots (shrubs and annuals growing together) and performances of plants growing with the artificial structures. Annuals had simultaneously strong negative and weak positive effects on shrub water status, growth, and reproductive output. Annuals also had an impact on the sex expression of shrubs by inducing shifts toward a higher male proportion in inflorescences of monoecious Ambrosia. In contrast, we found strong positive and weak or no negative effects of the shrubs on survival, biomass production, and seed production of the entire annual community and of selected annual species (the abundant native Chaenactis fremontii and the two dominant introduced annual species Bromus madritensis ssp. rubens and Schismus barbatus). Overall, in net effect, the interaction between shrubs and annuals can be described as facilitation or positive net effects of shrubs on annuals, and interference or negative net effects of annuals on shrubs. However, during the growing season, the ratios between positive and negative effects shifted. Annual plants benefited from the presence of shrubs to the greatest extent early in the growing season, and initial negative effects of annuals on shrubs declined as annuals senesced later in the season. Results of this study support the view that an experimental resolution of bidirectional positive and negative effects is necessary to achieve an accurate, mechanistic understanding of species interactions.},

This review discusses patterns and determinants of local, differential and regional plant diversity in all five regions.

Patterns of regional diversity are the result of differential speciation and extinction rates during the Quaternary. These rates have been influenced more by the incidence of fire and the severity of climate change than by environmental heterogeneity. All regions have a high number of rare and locally endemic taxa that survive as small populations, many of which are threatened by habitat transformation.},

Biodiversity is taken to be the integration of biological variability across all scales, from the genetic, through species and ecosystems, to landscapes. Conserving biodiversity is a daunting task, and the paper asserts that focusing on species is not the best approach. The best way to minimize species loss is to maintain the integrity of ecosystem function. The important questions therefore concern the kinds of biodiversity that are significant to ecosystem functioning. To best focus our efforts we need to establish how much (or how little) redundancy there is in the biological composition of ecosystems. An approach is suggested, based on the use of functional groups of organisms defined according to ecosystem processes. Functional groups with little or no redundancy warrant priority conservation effort. Complementary species-based approaches for maximizing the inclusion of biodiversity within a set of conservation areas are compared to the functional-group approach.},

	abstract = {* Facilitating effects of benefactor plants on plant species richness have been commonly tested in stressful habitats because competitive effects are assumed to predominate in more productive habitats. Here, we examine this assumption by testing whether benefactor plants can nonetheless be facilitating in competitive environments.


* We provide a conceptual framework describing how a trait of benefactor plants, canopy height of shrubs, can have a portfolio of facilitative effects on species richness in more competitive environments, and we provide an empirical assessment of this portfolio effect in tundra plant communities.


* Across tundra plant communities representing an extensive gradient in aboveground live biomass ranging from 11 to above 800 grams per m2, we found that species richness exhibited a humped-back relationship. Increasing canopy height of shrubs to a maximum height of what defines the dwarf shrub tundra, that is 40 cm, consistently and significantly increased species richness along the entire biomass gradient tested.


* The positive effect of shrub canopy height was not confounded with herbivore intensity, competitive interference or abiotic factors such as bedrock-weathered mineral availability, moisture availability or temperature. However, we cannot rule out that the general presence of large mammalian herbivory may have been central to the positive effect of shrub canopy height in reducing herbivore impacts on species richness.


* In this study, conceptual and empirical evidence support that increasing canopy height of shrubs facilitates species richness regardless of relative abiotic stress levels within tundra ecosystems. We propose that positive interactions can play an important ecological role in systems where competitive effects are observed or assumed. For tundra plant communities where climate change is currently causing encroachment of shrub species, the effects of increasing canopy height may have unprecedented effects on plant species richness.},

Abstract
Functional and phylogenetic diversity are increasingly quantified in various fields of ecology and conservation biology. The need to maintain diversity turnover among sites, so-called beta-diversity, has also been raised in theoretical and applied ecology. In this study, we propose the first comprehensive framework for the large-scale mapping of taxonomic, phylogenetic and functional diversity and of their respective turnover. Using high-resolution data on the spatial distribution and abundance of birds at a country scale, we disentangled areas of mismatches and congruencies between biodiversity components. We further revealed unequal representation of each component in protected areas: functional diversity was significantly under-represented whereas taxonomic diversity was significantly over-represented in protected areas. Our results challenge the use of any one diversity component as a surrogate for other components and stress the need to adopt an integrative approach to biodiversity conservation.},

	abstract = {* Deterministic niche-based processes have been proposed to explain species relative abundance within communities but lead to different predictions: habitat filtering (HF) predicts dominant species to exhibit similar traits while niche differentiation (ND) requires that species have dissimilar traits to coexist.


* Using a multiple trait-based approach, we evaluated the relative roles of HF and ND in determining species abundances in productive grasslands. Four dimensions of the functional niche of 12 co-occurring grass species were identified using 28 plant functional traits. Using this description of the species niche, we investigated patterns of functional similarity and dissimilarity and linked them to abundance in randomly assembled six-species communities subjected to fertilization/disturbance treatments.


* Our results suggest that HF and ND jointly determined species abundance by acting on contrasting niche dimensions. The effect of HF decreased relative to ND with increasing disturbance and decreasing fertilization. Dominant species exhibited similar traits in communities whereas dissimilarity favored the coexistence of rare species with dominants by decreasing inter-specific competition. This stabilizing effect on diversity was suggested by a negative relationship between species over-yielding and relative abundance.


* We discuss the importance of considering independent dimensions of functional niche to better understand species abundance and coexistence within communities.},

	abstract = {Multiple studies have shown that biodiversity loss can impair ecosystem processes, providing a sound basis for the general application of a precautionary approach to managing biodiversity. However, mechanistic details of species loss effects and the generality of impacts across ecosystem types are poorly understood. The functional niche is a useful conceptual tool for understanding redundancy, where the functional niche is defined as the area occupied by a species in an n-dimensional functional space. Experiments to assess redundancy based on a single functional attribute are biased towards finding redundancy, because species are more likely to have non-overlapping functional niches in a multi-dimensional functional space. The effect of species loss in any particular ecosystem will depend on i) the range of function and diversity of species within a functional group, ii) the relative partitioning of variance in functional space between and within functional groups, and iii) the potential for functional compensation (degree of functional niche overlap) of the species within a functional group. Future research on functional impairment with species loss should focus on identifying which species, functional groups, and ecosystems are most vulnerable to functional impairment from species loss, so that these can be prioritized for management activities directed at maintaining ecosystem function. This will require a better understanding of how the organization of diversity into discrete functional groups differs between different communities and ecosystems.},

In the ecological scenarios we investigate selection does not produce a correlation of the mean and variance of individual flowering time. Self-incompatibility causes weak stabilizing selection on flowering time that acts to reduce the within-individual variance in flowering time. Disruptive selection due to pollinator limitation acts mostly to increase the among-individual variance in flowering time. Stabilizing selection due to pollinator attraction, or short reproductive season, acts mostly to decrease the within-individual variance in flowering time. Temporal autocorrelation of environmental stochasticity in pollinator visitation rate strongly selects to increase the within-individual variance in flowering time. These predictions can be tested by measuring the causal factors described above, partitioning the variance in population phenology within and among individuals, and estimating the inheritance of, and selection on, within-individual mean and variance of flowering time.},

The concept has been applied to environmental, resource, functional trait, and morphometric axes and to different scales, i.e. from individuals, species, to communities and clades. Further, these shapes have been variously interpreted as niches, ecological or evolutionary strategy spaces, or proxies for community structure.

Although the SGH has been extensively discussed in plant community ecology in the past two decades, it has received little attention from animal ecologists. 3. To explore whether the SGH could be applied to animal communities, we conducted a litter decomposition experiment with aquatic detritivorous invertebrates in which we manipulated litter quality and measured species interactions along this resource quality gradient. Litter quality was manipulated by presenting detritivores with leaves of plant species varying in specific leaf area and decomposition rate in streams. 4. We found a switch from negative to neutral interactions with increasing resource quality stress, in line with the SGH. However, by re-examining other published results with aquatic detritivores from the perspective of the SGH, we found that a diversity of patterns seem to characterize detritivore interactions along stress gradients. 5. Although the basic pattern proposed by the SGH may not apply to animal systems in general, we show that aquatic detritivore interactions do change along stress gradients, which underlines the importance of incorporating environmental stressors more explicitly in B-EF research.},

	abstract = {A major challenge of ecological research is to assess the functional consequences of species richness loss over time and space in global biodiversity hotspots, where extinctions are happening at an unprecedented rate. To address this issue, greater realism needs to be incorporated into both conceptual and experimental approaches. Here we propose a conceptual model that incorporates body size as a critical aspect of community responses to environmental change, which we tested in the Western Amazonian rain forest, one of the most speciose ecosystems on the planet. We employed an exclosure removal experiment (replicated under 10 microhabitats and four climatic conditions) in which we manipulated access to two types of resource by the whole community of dung and carrion beetles ({\textgreater}60 species), depending on their size. Our 400 independent measurements revealed that changes in the number of species and functional groups, and temporal patterns in community composition, all affected resource burial rates, a key ecosystem process. Further, the functional contribution of species diversity in each size class was tightly dependent on beetle abundance, and while the role of large species could be performed by abundant smaller ones, and other naturally occurring decomposers, this was not the case when environmental conditions were harsher. These results demonstrate, for the first time in an animal assemblage in a tropical ecosystem, that although species may appear functionally redundant under one set of environmental conditions, many species would be needed to maintain ecosystem functioning at multiple temporal and spatial scales. This highlights the potential fragility of these systems to the ongoing global “Sixth Great Extinction,” whose effects are likely to be especially pronounced in the Tropics.},

	abstract = {The relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning (BEF) and its consequence for ecosystem services has predominantly been studied by controlled, short-term and small-scale experiments under standardized environmental conditions and constant community compositions. However, changes in biodiversity occur in real-world ecosystems with varying environments and a dynamic community composition. In this theme issue, we present novel research on BEF in such dynamic communities. The contributions are organized in three sections on BEF relationships in (i) multi-trophic diversity, (ii) non-equilibrium biodiversity under disturbance and varying environmental conditions, and (iii) large spatial and long temporal scales. The first section shows that multi-trophic BEF relationships often appear idiosyncratic, while accounting for species traits enables a predictive understanding. Future BEF research on complex communities needs to include ecological theory that is based on first principles of species-averaged body masses, stoichiometry and effects of environmental conditions such as temperature. The second section illustrates that disturbance and varying environments have direct as well as indirect (via changes in species richness, community composition and species' traits) effects on BEF relationships. Fluctuations in biodiversity (species richness, community composition and also trait dominance within species) can severely modify BEF relationships. The third section demonstrates that BEF at larger spatial scales is driven by different variables. While species richness per se and community biomass are most important, species identity effects and community composition are less important than at small scales. Across long temporal scales, mass extinctions represent severe changes in biodiversity with mixed effects on ecosystem functions. Together, the contributions of this theme issue identify new research frontiers and answer some open questions on BEF relationships in dynamic communities of real-world landscapes.},

In an effort to provide new data on this issue, we investigated the ability of SAC (alpacas and llamas), goats, horses, and rabbits to digest C3 (Bromus inermis) and C4 (Cynodon dactylon) grass hay with nearly equal nitrogen and cell wall concentrations. Dry matter digestibility (DMD) of the C3 grass hay was not significantly different between SAC and goats. Foregut fermenters (SAC and goats) digested C3 and C4 grasses more efficiently than hindgut fermenters (horses and rabbits). SAC digested C4 grass hays more efficiently than goats, possibly due to their relatively longer particulate matter mean retention times (71 and 54h, respectively). Apparent nitrogen digestibility was 9\% higher for all species with the C3 grass in comparison to C4 grass. This suggests that the highly-vascularized bundle sheath cells of C4 plants prevent efficient utilization of dietary nitrogen.},

These changes can be broadly grouped according to three nonexclusive mechanisms: (a) changes in the species composition of the networks (driven by interaction patterns of invaders, nonrandom extinction of species according to their traits, or differences among species in population responses across gradients); (b) changes that alter interaction frequencies via changes in search efficiency (driven by altered habitat structure or metabolic rates) or changes in spatial and temporal overlap; and (c) changes to coevolutionary processes and patterns. Taking spatial and temporal processes into account can further elucidate network variation and improve predictions of network responses to environmental change. Emerging evidence links network structure to ecosystem functioning; however, scaling up to metanetworks or multilayer networks may modify interpretations of network structure, stability, and functioning.},

In addition to determining which species survive, the nature and intensity of competitive interactions within the network also affect the growth, productivity, and abundances of those individuals that persist. As such, the competitive network structure may likewise play an important role in determining community-level functioning by capturing the net costs of competition. Here, using an experimental system comprising 18 wood decay basidiomycete fungi, we test this possibility by quantifying the links among competitive network structure, species diversity, and community function. We show that species diversity alone has negligible impacts on community functioning, but that diversity interacts with two key properties of the competitive network—competitive intransitivity and average competitive ability—to ultimately shape biomass production, respiration, and carbon use efficiency. Most notably, highly intransitive communities comprising weak competitors exhibited a positive diversity–function relationship, whereas weakly intransitive communities comprising strong competitors exhibited a negative relationship. These findings demonstrate that competitive network structure can be an important determinant of community-level functioning, capturing a gradient from weakly to strongly competitive communities. Our research suggests that the competitive network may therefore act as a unifying link between diversity and function, providing key insight as to how and when losses in biodiversity will impact ecosystem function.},

	abstract = {Quantifying the functional diversity in ecological communities is very promising for both studying the response of diversity to environmental gradients and the effects of diversity on ecosystem functioning (i.e. in "biodiversity experiments"). In our view, the Rao coefficient is a good candidate for an efficient functional diversity index. It is, in fact, a generalization of the Simpson's index of diversity and it can be used with various measures of dissimilarity between species (both those based on a single trait and those based on several traits). However, when intending to quantify the functional diversity, we have to make various methodological decisions such as how many and which traits to use, how to weight them, how to combine traits that are measured at different scales and how to quantify the species' relative abundances in a community. Here we discuss these issues with examples from real plant communities and argue that diversity within a single trait is often the most ecologically relevant information. When using indices based on many traits, we plead for careful a priori selection of ecologically relevant traits, although other options are also feasible. When combining many traits, often with different scales, methods considering the extent of species overlap in trait space can be applied for both the qualitative and quantitative traits. Another possibility proposed here is to decompose the variability of a trait in a community according to the relative effect of among- and within-species differentiation (with the latter not considered by current indices of functional diversity), in a way analogical to decomposition of Sum of squares in ANOVA. Further, we show why the functional diversity is more tightly related to species diversity (measured by Simpson index) when biomass is used as a measure of population abundance, in comparison with frequency. Finally, the general expectation is that functional diversity can be a better predictor of ecosystem functioning than the number of species or the number of functional groups. However, we demonstrate that some of the expectations might be overrated - in particular, the "sampling effect" in biodiversity experiments is not avoided when functional diversity is used as a predictor.},

Here, for the first time, we assessed the effects of alpha, beta and gamma diversity on ecosystem stability and the scale dependence of the slope of the diversity–stability relationship.


* By employing a long-term (33 years) dataset from a temperate grassland, northern China, we calculated the all possible spatial scales with the complete combination from the basic 1-m2 plots.


* Species richness was positively associated with ecosystem stability through species asynchrony and overyielding at all spatial scales (1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 m2). Both alpha and beta diversity were positively associated with gamma stability.


* Moreover, the slope of the diversity–area relationship was significantly higher than that of the stability–area relationship, resulting in a decline of the slope of the diversity–stability relationship with increasing area.


* Synthesis. With the positive species diversity effect on ecosystem stability from small to large spatial scales, our findings demonstrate the need to maintain a high biodiversity and biotic heterogeneity as insurance against the risks incurred by ecosystems in the face of global environmental changes.},

Recent modelling and conceptual work suggests that stability is a multidimensional construct comprising different response aspects. Using two freshwater mesocosm experiments as case studies, we show how the response to single perturbations can be decomposed in different stability aspects (resistance, resilience, recovery, temporal stability) for both ecosystem functions and community composition. We find that extended community recovery is tightly connected to a nearly complete recovery of the function (biomass production), whereas systems with incomplete recovery of the species composition ranged widely in their biomass compared to controls. Moreover, recovery was most complete when either resistance or resilience was high, the latter associated with low temporal stability around the recovery trend. In summary, no single aspect of stability was sufficient to reflect the overall stability of the system.},

The information contained in such interaction matrices depends on the sampling design, and typically, compounds preferences (specialization) and abundances (activity). Null models are the primary vehicles to disentangle the effects of specialization from those of sampling and abundance, but they ignore the feedback of network structure on abundances. Hence, network structure, as exemplified here by modularity, is difficult to link to specific causes. Indeed, various processes lead to modularity and to specific interaction patterns more generally. Inferring (co)evolutionary dynamics is even more challenging, as competition and trait matching yield identical patterns of interactions. A satisfactory resolution of the underlying factors determining network structure will require substantial additional information, not only on independently assessed abundances, but also on traits, and ideally on fitness consequences as measured in experimental setups.},

	abstract = {* To address the lack of information about the shape and extent of real dispersal kernels, Bullock et al. (Journal of Ecology 105:6-19, 2017) synthesised empirical information on seed dispersal distances. Testing the fit of a variety of probability density functions, they found no function was the best-fitting for all datasets but some outperformed others. Cousens et al. (Journal of Ecology, 2017) focus on the specific finding of the generally poor fit of the WALD function to wind dispersal data and use this to argue that mechanistically derived functions would not be expected to fit data particularly well.


* We agree in part with this argument and discuss the issues that may lead to poor fit, including the simplifying assumptions of the WALD and the complexity of the dispersal process. We explain the fundamental linkage between the mechanistic form of the WALD and the derived function used for fitting to data.


* We demonstrate, however, that the logic that a mechanistically based function could fit to data is valid, under the hypothesis that it encompasses the key processes determining the dispersal kernel. This argument is supported by the facts that: (1) our analyses and others have shown the WALD performs well in a number of cases; and (2) the WALD is the best-fitting function for an example in which we simulate dispersal data using a realistic representation of variability in the wind dispersal process.


* Synthesis. While there are reasons that mechanistically derived functions may not fit well to empirical data, they do in some empirical and simulated cases and this suggests they can capture the dispersal behaviour of real systems. Mechanistic functions should be explored along with other more general functions when describing empirical data to investigate their simplifying assumptions and to add to our arsenal of functions for analysing dispersal data. Analyses using these functions are critical if we are to move from simply describing the system in which the data were gathered to gaining more general insights into dispersal and predicting its consequences.},

Invasive species can alter species interactions and community dynamics directly by having larger detrimental effects on some species than others, or indirectly by changing the ways in which native species compete among themselves. We tested the direct and indirect effects of an invasive aphid herbivore on a native aphid species and two host milkweed species. The invasive aphid caused a 10-fold decrease in native aphid populations, and a 30\% increase in plant mortality (direct effects). The invasive aphid also increased the strength of interspecific competition between the two native plant hosts (indirect effects). By investigating the role that indirect effects play in shaping species interactions in native communities, our study highlights an understudied component of species invasions.},

	abstract = {As a compensatory response to herbivory, plants may branch vigorously when the growth of dormant meristems is triggered by shoot damage. Undamaged plants, on the other hand, often restrain branching, and this limitation on growth can be considered a cost of tolerance to herbivory. Restrained branching is caused by apical dominance and may, alternatively, be associated with fitness benefits in competitive environments that favor fast vertical growth. To test these hypotheses regarding selection for restrained branching, we compared the performance of two subspecies of the biennial grassland herb Gentianella campestris; the tall, apically dominant ssp. campestris and the short, multi-stemmed ssp. islandica, which shows reduced apical dominance. For both subspecies, we manipulated the height of surrounding vegetation (competition) and damage intensity in grasslands of differing productivity (high, medium, low), and examined population growth rates using matrix population models combined with life table response experiments (LTREs). In the absence of damage, ssp. campestris exhibited a higher population growth rate than ssp. islandica in the tallest vegetation, however with the growth rate still being below one. In the medium and low productivity environments where the vegetation was shorter, the population growth rate of ssp. islandica was considerably higher than that of ssp. campestris as long as no more than about 50\% of the plants were damaged. When plants were damaged, the apically dominant ssp. campestris showed a positive population growth rate (λ {\textgreater} 1) and often overcompensatory seed production in all productivity levels, while ssp. islandica showed no compensation and therefore the population was predicted to decline (λ {\textless} 1). We conclude that restrained branching in Gentianella cannot be selected for by competition alone, but that episodes of apical damage are required to maintain the trait. Furthermore, because of the costs of restrained branching, apical dominance should be selected against in grasslands where competition and disturbance are low. This article is protected by copyright.

We show that chance alone will drive 1\% or less of the community to dominate 50\% of all resources in situations where gains and losses are multiplicative, as in returns on assets or growth rates of populations. Key mechanisms that counteract such hyperdominance include natural enemies in nature and wealth-equalizing institutions in society. However, historical research of European developments over the past millennium suggests that such institutions become ineffective in times of societal upscaling. A corollary is that in a globalizing world, wealth will inevitably be appropriated by a very small fraction of the population unless effective wealth-equalizing institutions emerge at the global level.},

	abstract = {While the impacts of climate change on individual species and communities have been well documented there is little evidence on climate-mediated changes for entire ecosystems. Pristine alpine environments can provide unique insights into natural, physical and ecological response to climate change yet broad scale and long-term studies on these potential ‘ecosystem sentinels’ are scarce. We addressed this issue by examining cover changes of 1689 high-elevation wetlands (temporarily or perennial water-saturated grounds) in the Bolivian Cordillera Real, a region that has experienced significant warming and glacier melting over the last 30 years. We combined high spatial resolution satellite images from PLEIADES with the long-term images archive from LANDSAT to 1) examine environmental factors (e.g., glacier cover, wetland and watershed size) that affected wetland cover changes, and 2) identify wetlands’ features that affect their vulnerability (using habitat drying as a proxy) in the face of climate change. Over the (1984–2011) period, our data showed an increasing trend in the mean wetland total area and number, mainly related to the appearance of wet grassland patches during the wetter years. Wetland cover also showed high inter-annual variability and their area for a given year was positively correlated to precipitation intensities in the three months prior to the image date. Also, round wetlands located in highly glacierized catchments were less prone to drying, while relatively small wetlands with irregularly shaped contours suffered the highest rates of drying over the last three decades. High Andean wetlands can therefore be considered as ecosystem sentinels for climate change, as they seem sensitive to glacier melting. Beyond the specific focus of this study, our work illustrates how satellite-based monitoring of ecosystem sentinels can help filling the lack of information on the ecological consequences of current and changing climate conditions, a common and crucial issue especially in less-developed countries.},

	abstract = {Community ecologists are active in describing species by their functional traits, quantifying the functional structure of plant and animal assemblages and inferring community assembly processes with null-model analyses of trait distribution and functional diversity indices. Intraspecific variation in traits and effects of spatial scale are potentially important in these analyses. Here, we introduce the R package cati (Community Assembly by Traits: Individuals and beyond) available on CRAN, for the analysis of community assembly with functional traits. cati builds on a recent approach to community assembly that explicitly incorporates individual differences in community assembly analyses and decomposes phenotypic variations across scales and organizational levels, based on three phenotypic variance ratios, termed the T-statistics. More generally, the cati package 1) calculates a variety of single-trait and multi-trait indices from interspecific and intraspecific trait measures; 2) it partitions functional trait variation among spatial and taxonomic levels; 3) it implements a palette of flexible null models for detecting non-random patterns of functional traits. These patterns can be used to draw inferences about hypotheses of community assembly such as environmental filtering and species interactions. The basic input for cati is a data frame in which columns are traits, rows are species or individuals, and entries are the measured trait values. The cati package can also incorporate a square distance matrix into analyses, which could include phylogenetic or genetic distances among individuals or species. Users select from a variety of functional trait metrics and analyze these relative to a null model that specifies trait distributions in a regional source pool.},

Predicting the future of tropical forests depends on a solid understanding of the drivers of seedling survival. At the same time, factors determining spatial and temporal patterns of seedling survival can play a large role in permitting species coexistence in diverse communities. Using long-term data on the survival of more than 45 000 seedlings of 238 species in a Neotropical forest, we assessed the relative importance of key abiotic and biotic neighbourhood variables thought to influence individual seedling survival and tested whether species vary significantly in their responses to these variables, consistent with niche differences. At the community level, seedling survival was significantly correlated with plant size, topographic habitat, neighbourhood densities of conspecific seedlings, conspecific and heterospecific trees and annual variation in water availability, in descending order of effect size. Additionally, we found significant variation among species in their sensitivity to light and water availability, as well as in their survival within different topographic habitats, indicating the potential for niche differentiation among species that could allow for species coexistence.},

Here we explore the rate of change during the degradation of a semiarid ecosystem with a model coupling the vegetation and geomorphological system. Two stable states—vegetated and bare—are identified, and it is shown that the change between these states is a critical transition. Surprisingly, the critical transition between the vegetated and bare state can unfold either rapidly over a few years or gradually over decennia up to millennia, depending on parameter values. An important condition for the phenomenon is the linkage between slow and fast ecosystems components. Our results show that, next to climate change and disturbance rates, the geological and geomorphological setting of a semiarid ecosystem is crucial in predicting its fate.},

	abstract = {Evolutionary rescue describes a situation where adaptive evolution prevents the extinction of a population facing a stressing environment. Models of evolutionary rescue could in principle be used to predict the level of stress beyond which extinction becomes likely for species of conservation concern, or conversely the treatment levels most likely to limit the emergence of resistant pests or pathogens. Stress levels are known to affect both the rate of population decline (demographic effect) and the speed of adaptation (evolutionary effect), but the latter aspect has received less attention. Here, we address this issue using Fisher's Geometric Model of adaptation. In this model, the fitness effects of mutations depend both on the genotype and the environment in which they arise. In particular, the model introduces a dependence between the level of stress, the proportion of rescue mutants, and their costs before the onset of stress. We obtain analytic results under a strong-selection-weak-mutation regime, which we compare to simulations. We show that the effect of the environment on evolutionary rescue can be summarized into a single composite parameter quantifying the effective stress level, which is amenable to empirical measurement. We describe a narrow characteristic stress window over which the rescue probability drops from very likely to very unlikely as the level of stress increases. This drop is sharper than in previous models, as a result of the decreasing proportion of stress-resistant mutations as stress increases. We discuss how to test these predictions with rescue experiments across gradients of stress.},

	abstract = {The functional trait composition of plant communities reflects the influence of ecological constraints on their assembly. In high-elevation peatlands of the Andes, multiple abiotic and biotic stresses are exerted on herbaceous plant communities. We hypothesized that dominant cushion-plant species found in these ecosystems strongly influence the dynamics of their subordinate plants by providing protection against external stress. To test the hypothesis, we addressed the variation of functional traits reflecting how subordinate plants invest in durable tissues and develop below and above the canopy of two cushion-plant species dominating the ecosystem, with varying intensity of herbivore pressure. We expected different functional composition of plants living below (understory stratum) and above (emergent stratum) the canopy, related to cushion-plant protection. In addition, we considered the functional composition of basic morphological guilds, forbs and graminoids, as they invest differently in plant development and respond differently to herbivore pressure. We found contrasted functional compositions among morphological guilds and according to the position relatively to cushion-plant canopy. These variations support a protective influence of cushion-plants on subordinate plants for both strata, with investment into less costly leaves and a larger stature when protection is greater, depending on cushion-plant species and cushion-plant height. External stress mainly affected emergent plants and led to different responses according to the guild. Graminoids showed avoidant strategy, while forbs shifted from avoidant to tolerant strategy with increasing herbivore pressure. Both between-species and intraspecific trait variations contributed to explain functional changes of guilds, but the relative contributions depended on morphological guild and stratum. A basic trade-off in physiological and morphological variability determined different relative contribution in forbs and graminoids. While functional ecology classically focuses on the composition of spatially delimited communities, we here underline the need to address separately the functional composition and assembly dynamics of distinct guilds making a community. In addition, our survey is the first to investigate the functional ecology of high-elevation tropical peatlands and provides novel insights into vegetation ecology in this stressful ecosystem.},

Theory predicts that additional insurance effects of biodiversity on ecosystem functioning could emerge across time and space if species respond asynchronously to environmental variation and if species become increasingly dominant when and where they are most productive. Even if only a few dominant species maintain ecosystem functioning within a particular time and place, ecosystem functioning may be enhanced by many different species across many times and places (??diversity). Here, we develop and apply a new approach to estimate these previously unquantified insurance effects of biodiversity on ecosystem functioning that arise due to species turnover across times and places. In a long?term (18?year) grassland plant diversity experiment, we find that total insurance effects are positive in sign and substantial in magnitude, amounting to 19\% of the net biodiversity effect, mostly due to temporal insurance effects. Species loss can therefore reduce ecosystem functioning both locally and by eliminating species that would otherwise enhance ecosystem functioning across temporally fluctuating and spatially heterogeneous environments.},

	abstract = {One of the fundamental challenges in ecology is to identify the signature of assembly mechanisms resulting from patterns of community composition. For this purpose, the trait-based approach has promoted the analysis of functional trait distributions within communities. Until now, much attention has been paid to the design of appropriate null models and the definition of relevant functional metrics for inferring community assembly mechanisms from trait distributions. However, less consideration were given to the set of methodological choices preceding the statistical analysis – i.e. from designing a sampling scheme to measuring traits – and how likely they influence the conclusions drawn, as this may subject the analysis to methodological biases. In this regard, a comprehensive perspective on how the overall set of methodological choices influence the inference of community assembly mechanisms is needed. We extensively reviewed recent studies that have addressed animal and plant community assembly by applying a trait-based null model approach. We analyzed how the set of methodological choices in these studies depended on the mechanisms of interest and how they could influence the conclusions drawn by the authors. We found that methodological choices only weakly depended on the hypothesized assembly mechanisms studied by the authors, especially because the two main assembly mechanisms hypothesized, i.e. environmental filtering and limiting similarity, were often tested based on a common experimental design. In contrast, the detection of assembly mechanisms was strongly dependent on the sampling scale, the type of data, the origin of trait values and the delineation of the reference species pool, while less affected by the null model and the functional metrics chosen. These results underline plausible methodological biases in favor of the detection of certain mechanisms to the detriment of others. In addition, there was a significant relationship between the predominant mechanisms concluded by the authors and the type of organism used as biological model, suggesting either that the methodological choices depend on a common strategy used by the different authors when studying similar biological models, or that the methodological choices depended on certain particular properties of the organisms. From this extensive review, we highlight major conceptual and methodological issues that need to be addressed in trait-based null model approaches. We synthesize the methodological choices relevant to study several assembly mechanisms while minimizing methodological biases. We then derive practical guidelines and emphasize the importance of spatial structure in sampling strategy and null model design, because of the scale-dependent signatures of ecological processes.},

To disentangle the role of external and internal filters on phenotypic diversity within ecological communities, we examined the patterns of life?history trait variation within a guild of insect parasitoids during two successive years across three contrasted regions in relation to several ecological factors. By combining a mean?field approach and an analysis of phenotypic variance across organizational levels (from individual to guild), we showed that the patterns of life?history trait variation across regions are consistent with local adaptation or adaptive phenotypic plasticity while the patterns of phenotypic variation within regions suggested how coexistence modulates life?history traits expression through niche differentiation. Within a given region, phenotypic pattern of parasitoid life?history traits may also arise from bottom?up effects of trophic webs: insect host species could also control parasitoid life?history traits in nature. Our results also showed that parasitoid life?history traits presented contrasting variation patterns according to the sampling year, suggesting temporal variations in evolutionary and ecological dynamics of parasitoid species. The application of such trait?based studies to insect parasitoids has the potential to provide further insight on how agricultural environments contribute to differential diversification among natural enemies guilds, highlighting the main role of agricultural landscape management for organisms'responses.

The impact of exploitative competition on population dynamics has been extensively studied from empirical and theoretical points of view, but the consequences of interference competition remain poorly understood. Here we study the effect of different levels of intraspecific interference competition on the dynamics of a size-structured population. We study a physiologically structured population model accounting for direct individual interactions, allowing for a gradient from exploitative competition to interference competition. We parameterize our model with data on experimental populations of the collembolan Folsomia candida. Our model predicts contrasting dynamics, depending on the level of interference competition. With low interference, our model predicts juvenile-driven generation cycles, but interference competition tends to dampen these cycles. With intermediate interference, giant individuals emerge and start dominating the population. Finally, strong interference competition causes a novel kind of adult-driven generation cycles referred to as interference-induced cycles. Our results shed new light on the interpretation of the size-structured dynamics of natural and experimental populations.},

	abstract = {As global environmental conditions continue to change at an unprecedented rate, many species will experience increases in natural and anthropogenic stress. Generally speaking, selection is expected to favor adaptations that reduce the negative impact of environmental stress (i.e., stress tolerance). However, natural environmental variables typically fluctuate, exhibiting various degrees of temporal autocorrelation, known as environmental colors, which may complicate evolutionary responses to stress. Here we combine experiments and theory to show that temporal environmental autocorrelation can determine long-term evolutionary responses to stress without affecting the total amount of stress experienced over time. Experimental evolution of RNA virus lineages in differing environmental autocorrelation treatments agreed closely with predictions from our theoretical models that stress tolerance is favored in less autocorrelated (whiter) environments but disfavored in more autocorrelated (redder) environments. This is explained by an interaction between environmental autocorrelation and a phenotypic trade-off between stress tolerance and reproductive ability. The degree to which environmental autocorrelation influences evolutionary trajectories depends on the shape of this trade-off as well as the relative level of tolerance exhibited by novel mutants. These results suggest that long-term evolutionary dynamics depend not only on the overall strength of selection but also on the way that selection is distributed over time.},

	abstract = {A general model of competitive and apparent competitive interactions in a spatially-variable environment is developed and analyzed to extend findings on coexistence in a temporally-variable environment to the spatial case and to elucidate new principles. In particular, coexistence mechanisms are divided into variation-dependent and variation-independent mechanisms with variation-dependent mechanisms including spatial generalizations of relative nonlinearity and the storage effect. Although directly analogous to the corresponding temporal mechanisms, these spatial mechanisms involve different life history traits which suggest that the spatial storage effect should arise more commonly than the temporal storage effect and spatial relative nonlinearity should arise less commonly than temporal relative nonlinearity. Additional mechanisms occur in the spatial case due to spatial covariance between the finite rate of increase of a local population and its local abundance, which has no clear temporal analogue. A limited analysis of these additional mechanisms shows that they have similar properties to the storage effect and relative nonlinearity and potentially may be considered as enlargements of the earlier mechanisms. The rate of increase of a species perturbed to low density is used to quantify coexistence. A general quadratic approximation, which is exact in some important cases, divides this rate of increase into contributions from the various mechanisms above and admits no other mechanisms, suggesting that opportunities for coexistence in a spatially-variable environment are fully characterized by these mechanisms within this general model. Three spatially-implicit models are analyzed as illustrations of the general findings and of techniques using small variance approximations. The contributions to coexistence of the various mechanisms are expressed in terms of simple interpretable formulae. These spatially-implicit models include a model of an annual plant community, a spatial multispecies version of the lottery model, and a multispecies model of an insect community competing for spatially-patchy and ephemeral food.},

	abstract = {The ubiquity of cooperative cross-feeding (a resource-exchange mutualism) raises two related questions: Why is cross-feeding favored over self-sufficiency, and how are cross-feeders protected from non-producing cheaters? The Black Queen Hypothesis suggests that if leaky resources are costly, then there should be selection for either gene loss or self-sufficiency, but selection against mutualistic inter-dependency. Localized interactions have been shown to protect mutualists against cheaters, though their effects in the presence of self-sufficient organisms are not well understood. Here we develop a stochastic spatial model to examine how spatial effects alter the predictions of the Black Queen Hypothesis. Microbes need two essential resources to reproduce, which they can produce themselves (at a cost) or take up from neighbors. Additionally, microbes need empty sites to give birth into. Under well mixed mean-field conditions, the cross-feeders will always be displaced by a non-producer and a self-sufficient microbe. However, localized interactions have two effects that favor production. First, a microbe that interacts with a small number of neighbors will not always receive the essential resources it needs; this effect slightly harms cross-feeders but greatly harms non-producers. Second, microbes tend to displace other microbes that produce resources they need; this effect also slightly harms cross-feeders but greatly harms non-producers. Our work therefore suggests localized interactions produce an accelerating cost of non-production. Thus, the right trade-off between the cost of producing resources and the cost of sometimes being resource-limited can favor mutualistic inter-dependence over both self-sufficiency and non-production.},

	abstract = {Species interactions are traditionally seen as the outcome of both ecological and evolutionary mechanisms. Among them, the two most frequently studied are the neutral role of species abundances in determining encounter probability and the deterministic role of species identity (traits and evolutionary history) in determining the compatibility of interacting. Nevertheless, the occurrence of pairwise interactions also depends on the spatio-temporal context imposed by the ecological neighborhood (i.e. the indirect effect of other local species sharing traits and interaction potential with the focal ones). Although a few studies have begun to examine neighborhood effects on community interactions, these have not incorporated neighborhood structure as a complementary driver of pairwise interactions within an integrative approach. Here we describe the spatial structure of pairwise interactions between three fleshy-fruited tree species and six frugivorous thrush species within the same locality of the Cantabrian Range (Iberian Peninsula). Using a spatio-temporally fine-grained dataset sampled during three years, we aimed to detect spatial patterns of interactions and to evaluate their concordance across years. We also evaluated the simultaneous roles played by species abundance, species identity and the ecological neighborhood in determining the pairwise interaction frequencies based on fruit removal. Our results showed that the abundances of fruit and bird species involved in plant-frugivore interactions, and the spatial patterns of these interactions, varied among years, and this was mainly due to different fruiting landscapes responding to masting events of distinct plant species. Despite high interannual differences in species abundances and the pairwise interaction frequencies, the main mechanisms underpinning the occurrence of pairwise interactions remained constant. Most of the variability in pairwise interactions was always explained by interacting fruit and bird species’ abundances. Ecological neighborhood, characterized as the net quantity of forest cover, heterospecific fruit crops, and heterospecific bird abundances in the immediate surroundings, also affected pairwise interaction frequency through its indirect effects on the abundance of interacting bird species. Our results highlight the prevalence of neutral forces in highly generalized plant-frugivore assemblages as well as the influence of indirect interactions (competition and/or facilitation with other local species) as another important driver to consider when predicting pairwise interactions.},

	abstract = {Facilitation processes constitute basic elements of vegetation dynamics in harsh systems. Recent studies in tropical alpine environments demonstrated how pioneer plant species defined as “ecosystem engineers” are capable of enhancing landscape-level richness by adding new species to the community through the modification of microhabitats, and also provided hints about the alternation of different ecosystem engineers over time. Nevertheless, most of the existing works analysed different ecosystem engineers separately, without considering the interaction of different ecosystem engineers. Focusing on the altitudinal limit of Peruvian Dry Puna vegetation, we hypothesized that positive interactions structure plant communities by facilitation cascades involving different ecosystem engineers, determining the evolution of the microhabitat patches in terms of abiotic resources and beneficiary species hosted. To analyze successional mechanisms, we used a “space-for-time” substitution to account for changes over time, and analyzed data on soil texture, composition, and temperature, facilitated species and their interaction with nurse species, and surface area of engineered patches by means of chemical analyses, indicator species analysis, and rarefaction curves. A successional process, resulting from the dynamic interaction of different ecosystem engineers, which determined a progressive amelioration of soil conditions (e.g. nitrogen and organic matter content, and temperature), was the main driver of species assemblage at the community scale, enhancing species richness. Cushion plants act as pioneers, by starting the successional processes that continue with shrubs and tussocks. Tussock grasses have sometimes been found to be capable of creating microhabitat patches independently. The dynamics of species assemblage seem to follow the nested assemblage mechanism, in which the first foundation species to colonize a habitat provides a novel substrate for colonization by other foundation species through a facilitation cascade process.},

However, species-specific effects of ecosystem engineers remain little explored, particularly in the alpine tropics. We investigated the effects of two cushion plants with subtle differences in morphological traits in a tropical Andean ecosystem. We asked whether these foundation species differed in their effects on local abiotic factors, species richness and the structure of plant assemblages growing within them. Location La Culata National Park, northern tropical Andes, Venezuela. Methods We determined shallow soil temperature, soil organic matter and water content within two co-existing cushion species, the larger and more compact Azorella julianii and the smaller and denser Arenaria musciformis, and in adjacent open areas. We also recorded the total number of plant species growing within both cushion species, and in paired open areas at three sites. We then compared local species richness, total plant abundance and the abundance of each species within cushions and outside using the relative interaction index (RII), and community dissimilarity patterns using NMDS ordination. We also compared species accumulation curves across sites between the cushions and open areas. Results Both cushions had similar positive effects on soil organic matter, but soil water content was increased only with Azorella. Both cushions had a positive effect on local species richness and total plant abundance. In addition, both species significantly modified species abundance patterns, showing a positive association with several species, many of them grasses. However, facilitative effects on other species were generally stronger for Azorella than Arenaria. Moreover, community structure of plants growing within the two cushion plants differed. The exotic invader Rumex acetosella increased in abundance within Azorella but not Arenaria. Conclusions We found evidence for species-specific effects of ecosystem engineers in the alpine tropics; two cushion species with subtly contrasting traits had different effects on microhabitat conditions and plant assemblages. This could in turn increase abiotic and biotic heterogeneity and promote species co-existence and emphasizes interdependence among species in alpine plant communities.},

Matching classical theoretical expectations, these characteristics defined a distinct tradeoff surface, and models parameterised with these characteristics closely matched observations from experimental multi-species mixtures. Importantly, predictions improved significantly when we incorporated information from tradeoffs by ‘snapping’ characteristics to the nearest location on the tradeoff surface, suggesting that the tradeoffs and mechanisms we identify are important determinants of local community structure.

	abstract = {Symbiotic nitrogen (N)-fixing plants are abundant during primary succession, as typical bedrocks lack available N. In turn, fixed N accumulates in soils through biomass turnover and recycling, favouring more nitrophilous organisms. Yet, it is unclear how this facilitation mechanism interacts with competition for other limiting nutrients such as phosphorus (P) and how this affects succession. Here, we introduce a resource-explicit, community assembly model of N-fixing species and analyze successional trajectories along resource availability gradients using contemporary niche theory. We show that facilitation-driven succession occurs under low N and high enough P availabilities, and is characterised by autogenic ecosystem development and relatively ordered trajectories. We show that late facilitation-driven succession is sensitive to catastrophic shifts, highlighting the need to invoke other mechanisms to explain ecosystem stability near the climax. Put together with competition-driven succession, these results lead to an enriched version of Tilman's resource-ratio theory of succession.},

	abstract = {Species richness increases with energy availability, yet there is little consensus as to the exact processes driving this species–energy relationship. The most straightforward explanation is the more-individuals hypothesis (MIH). It states that higher energy availability promotes a higher total number of individuals in a community, which consequently increases species richness by allowing for a greater number of species with viable populations. Empirical support for the MIH is mixed, partially due to the lack of proper formalisation of the MIH and consequent confusion as to its exact predictions. Here, we review the evidence of the MIH and evaluate the reliability of various predictions that have been tested. There is only limited evidence that spatial variation in species richness is driven by variation in the total number of individuals. There are also problems with measures of energy availability, with scale-dependence, and with the direction of causality, as the total number of individuals may sometimes itself be driven by the number of species. However, even in such a case the total number of individuals may be involved in diversity regulation. We propose a formal theory that encompasses these processes, clarifying how the different factors affecting diversity dynamics can be disentangled.},

Recent theory suggests that competitive interactions will lead to groups, or clusters, of species with similar traits. However, theoretical predictions typically assume complete knowledge of the map between competition and measured traits. These assumptions limit the plausible application of these patterns for inferring competitive interactions in nature. Here, we relax these restrictions and find that the clustering pattern is robust to contributions of unknown or unobserved niche axes. However, it may not be visible unless measured traits are close proxies for niche strategies. We conclude that patterns along single niche axes may reveal properties of interspecific competition in nature, but detecting these patterns requires natural history expertise firmly tying traits to niches.},

We show facilitation to be a ubiquitous driver of biodiversity by first noting that all species use resources and thus change the local biotic or abiotic conditions, altering the available multidimensional niches. This can cause a shift in local species composition, which can cause an increase in beta, and sometimes alpha, diversity. We show that these increases are ubiquitous across ecosystems. These positive effects on diversity occur via a broad host of disparate direct and indirect mechanisms. We identify and unify several of these facilitative mechanisms and discuss why it has been easy to underappreciate the importance of facilitation. We show that net positive effects have a long history of being considered ecologically or evolutionarily unstable, and we present recent evidence of its potential stability. Facilitation goes well beyond the common case of stress amelioration and it probably gains importance as community complexity increases. While biodiversity is, in part, created by species exploiting many niches, many niches are available to exploit only because species create them.},

The distribution of tree size in tropical forests follows a power-law regardless of location. This pattern has largely eluded mechanistic explanation. Using 30 years of tree demography and growth data from a forest plot in Panama, Farrior et al. show that the power-law size structure emerges after natural local disturbances such as the gaps formed by falling trees. A model of forest dynamics identifies the structural parameter governing the power-law distribution. A mechanistic understanding of tropical forest structural dynamics will benefit forest carbon cycling studies.
Science, this issue p. 155
Tropical tree size distributions are remarkably consistent despite differences in the environments that support them. With data analysis and theory, we found a simple and biologically intuitive hypothesis to explain this property, which is the foundation of forest dynamics modeling and carbon storage estimates. After a disturbance, new individuals in the forest gap grow quickly in full sun until they begin to overtop one another. The two-dimensional space-filling of the growing crowns of the tallest individuals relegates a group of losing, slow-growing individuals to the understory. Those left in the understory follow a power-law size distribution, the scaling of which depends on only the crown area–to–diameter allometry exponent: a well-conserved value across tropical forests.
The consistency of tropical tree size structure is related to the frequency of small-scale disturbance and competition for light.

One interesting idea is the keystone community concept (KCC); this posits that there may be some patches that have a disproportionately large effect on the metacommunity compared to other patches. We experimentally test the KCC by using replicate protist microcosm metacommunities with single?patch removals. Removing single patches had no effect on average community richness, evenness and biomass of our metacommunities, but did cause metacommunities to be assembled significantly less by local environmental conditions and more by spatial effects related to stochastic factors. Overall our results show that local patch removal can have large regional effects on structural processes, but indicate that more experiments are needed to find evidence of keystone communities.},

An example is logistic growth, modeling the effects of intraspecific competition, while the Lotka-Volterra equations for competition extend this to systems of multiple species, with varying strengths of intra- and inter-specific competition. These equations are a classic and well-used staple of quantitative ecology, providing a framework to understand species interactions, species coexistence, and community assembly. They can be derived from an assumption of random mixing of organisms, and an outcome of each interaction that removes one or more individuals. However, this framing is some- what unsatisfactory, and ecologists may prefer to think of phenomenological equations for competition as deriving from competition for a set of resources required for growth, which in turn may undergo their own complex dynamics. While it is intuitive that these frameworks are connected, and the connection is well-understood near to equilibria, here we ask the question: when can consumer dynamics alone become an exact description of a full system of consumers and resources? We identify that consumer- resource systems with this property must have some kind of redundancy in the original description, or equivalently there is one or more conservation laws for quantities that do not change with time. Such systems are known in mathematics as integrable systems. We suggest that integrability in consumer- resource dynamics can only arise in cases where each species in an assemblage requires a distinct and unique combination of resources, and even in these cases it is not clear that the resulting dynamics will lead to Lotka-Volterra competition.},

Using a metacommunity simulation incorporating quantitative models of trait evolution and community assembly, I assessed the performance of different tests that have been used to measure community phylogenetic structure. All tests were sensitive to the relative phylogenetic signal in species metacommunity abundances and traits; methods that were most sensitive to the effects of niche-based processes on community structure were also more likely to find non-random patterns of community phylogenetic structure under dispersal assembly. When used with a null model that maintained species occurrence frequency in random communities, several metrics could detect niche-based assembly when there was strong phylogenetic signal in species traits, when multiple traits were involved in community assembly, and in the presence of environmental heterogeneity. Interpretations of the causes of community phylogenetic structure should be modified to account for the influence of dispersal.},

	abstract = {It is argued that the problem of pattern and scale is the central problem in ecology, unifying population biology and ecosystems science, and marrying basic and applied ecology. Applied challenges, such as the prediction of the ecological causes and consequences of global climate change, require the interfacing of phenomena that occur on very different scales of space, time, and ecological organization. Furthermore, there is no single natural scale at which ecological phenomena should be studied; systems generally show characteristic variability on a range of spatial, temporal, and organizational scales. The observer imposes a perceptual bias, a filter through which the system is viewed. This has fundamental evolutionary significance, since every organism is an 'observer' of the environment, and life history adaptations such as dispersal and dormancy alter the perceptual scales of the species, and the observed variability. It likewise has fundamental significance for our own study of ecological systems, since the patterns that are unique to any range of scales will have unique causes and biological consequences. The key to prediction and understanding lies in the elucidation of mechanisms underlying observed patterns. Typically, these mechanisms operate at different scales than those on which the patterns are observed; in some cases, the patterns must be understood as emerging form the collective behaviors of large ensembles of smaller scale units. In other cases, the pattern is imposed by larger scale constraints. Examination of such phenomena requires the study of how pattern and variability change with the scale of description, and the development of laws for simplification, aggregation, and scaling. Examples are given from the marine and terrestrial literatures.},

	abstract = {The timely publication of scientific results is essential for dynamic advances in science. The ubiquitous availability of computers which are connected to a global network made the rapid and low-cost distribution of information through electronic channels possible. New concepts, such as Open Access publishing and preprint servers are currently changing the traditional print media business towards a community-driven peer production. However, the cost of scientific literature generation, which is either charged to readers, authors or sponsors, is still high. The main active participants in the authoring and evaluation of scientific manuscripts are volunteers, and the cost for online publishing infrastructure is close to negligible. A major time and cost factor is the formatting of manuscripts in the production stage. In this article we demonstrate the feasibility of writing scientific manuscripts in plain markdown (MD) text files, which can be easily converted into common publication formats, such as PDF, HTML or EPUB, using Pandoc. The simple syntax of Markdown assures the long-term readability of raw files and the development of software and workflows. We show the implementation of typical elements of scientific manuscripts—formulas, tables, code blocks and citations—and present tools for editing, collaborative writing and version control. We give an example on how to prepare a manuscript with distinct output formats, a DOCX file for submission to a journal, and a LATEX/PDF version for deposition as a PeerJ preprint. Further, we implemented new features for supporting ‘semantic web’ applications, such as the ‘journal article tag suite’—JATS, and the ‘citation typing ontology’—CiTO standard. Reducing the work spent on manuscript formatting translates directly to time and cost savings for writers, publishers, readers and sponsors. Therefore, the adoption of the MD format contributes to the agile production of open science literature. Pandoc Scholar is freely available from https://github.com/pandoc-scholar.},

	abstract = {Plant establishment is a challenge in semiarid environments due to intense and frequent drought periods. The presence of neighboring trees (nurses) can increase the establishment of seedlings (targets) by improving resource availability and microclimate. The nurse effect, however, might vary depending on nurse-target species combinations but factors that predict this specificity are poorly known. We used a multispecies experiment to investigate the facilitation potential of trees from a range of successional stages, focusing on how nurse functional traits can predict species-specific interaction outcomes. We conducted a factorial field experiment in a Brazilian semiarid tropical forest during a severe drought period. Sixty pairs of interacting tree species, 20 potential nurses, and three targets were used. Seedlings of all targets were planted both under and far from the nurse canopy, in a randomized block design replicated five times. Target growth and survival were monitored for 275 days from the beginning of the dry season, and interaction outcomes were calculated using the Relative Interaction Intensity (RII) index. Nurse functional traits such as successional stage, height, wood density, and canopy diameter were used as explanatory variables to predict RII values. The average effect of nurse species on target plants was in general positive, that is, seedling survival and growth increased under the nurse canopy. However, for growth pairwise interactions were significantly species specific. Successional stage was the only functional trait explaining RII values, with pioneer tree species being stronger facilitators than later successional trees. However, the explanation power of this variable was low, and positive, negative, or neutral interactions were found among nurse trees of all successional stages. Because seedling mortality during drought in semiarid systems is high, future studies should investigate how nurse traits related to water use could influence nurse facilitation skills.},

Even though a complete appreciation of the effects of perturbations on ecosystems requires the simultaneous measurement of these multiple components of stability, most ecological research has focused on one or a few of those components analysed in isolation. Here, we present a new view of ecological stability that recognises explicitly the non-independence of components of stability. This provides an approach for simplifying the concept of stability. We illustrate the concept and approach using results from a field experiment, and show that the effective dimensionality of ecological stability is considerably lower than if the various components of stability were unrelated. However, strong perturbations can modify, and even decouple, relationships among individual components of stability. Thus, perturbations not only increase the dimensionality of stability but they can also alter the relationships among components of stability in different ways. Studies that focus on single forms of stability in isolation therefore risk underestimating significantly the potential of perturbations to destabilise ecosystems. In contrast, application of the multidimensional stability framework that we propose gives a far richer understanding of how communities respond to perturbations.},

We describe the research done on generic abundance-based signals of instability that are derived from the phenomenon of critical slowing down, which represent the genesis of EWSs research. We highlight some of the issues facing the detection of such signals in biological systems – which are inherently complex and show low signal-to-noise ratios. We then document research on alternative signals of instability, including measuring shifts in spatial autocorrelation and trait dynamics, and discuss potential future directions for EWSs research based on detailed demographic and phenotypic data. We set EWSs research in the greater field of predictive ecology and weigh up the costs and benefits of simplicity vs. complexity in predictive models, and how the available data should steer the development of future methods. Finally, we identify some key unanswered questions that, if solved, could improve the applicability of these methods.},

Networks are often characterized by clusters of constituents that interact more closely with each other and have more connections to one another than they do with the rest of the components of the network. However, systematically identifying and studying such community structure in complicated networks is not easy, especially when the network interactions change over time or contain multiple types of connections, as seen in many biological regulatory networks or social networks. Mucha et al. (p. 876) developed a mathematical method to allow detection of communities that may be critical functional units of such networks. Application to real-world tasks—like making sense of the voting record in the U.S. Senate—demonstrated the promise of the method.
Network science is an interdisciplinary endeavor, with methods and applications drawn from across the natural, social, and information sciences. A prominent problem in network science is the algorithmic detection of tightly connected groups of nodes known as communities. We developed a generalized framework of network quality functions that allowed us to study the community structure of arbitrary multislice networks, which are combinations of individual networks coupled through links that connect each node in one network slice to itself in other slices. This framework allows studies of community structure in a general setting encompassing networks that evolve over time, have multiple types of links (multiplexity), and have multiple scales.
A general mathematical method used to identify closely interacting groups can explain the behavior of complicated networks.

We use a multi-year hummingbird–plant time series, divided into training and testing data, to show that including models of detectability and occurrence improves forecasts of mutualistic interactions. We then extend our model to explore interaction betadiversity across two distinct seasons. Despite differences in the observed interactions among seasons, there was no significant change in hummingbird occurrence or interaction frequency between hummingbirds and plants. These results highlight the challenge of inferring the causes of interaction betadiversity when interaction detectability is low. Finally, we highlight potential applications of our model for integrating observations of local interactions with biogeographic and evolutionary histories of co-occurring species.

By combining a model approach and a meta-analysis of a large collection of ecological networks, Thébault and Fontaine (p. 853; see the Perspective by Bascompte) found that network architecture and stability fundamentally differed between trophic networks that involved herbivory and mutualistic networks that involved pollination. These findings have implications for the understanding of community structure, evolution, and response to perturbation.
Research on the relationship between the architecture of ecological networks and community stability has mainly focused on one type of interaction at a time, making difficult any comparison between different network types. We used a theoretical approach to show that the network architecture favoring stability fundamentally differs between trophic and mutualistic networks. A highly connected and nested architecture promotes community stability in mutualistic networks, whereas the stability of trophic networks is enhanced in compartmented and weakly connected architectures. These theoretical predictions are supported by a meta-analysis on the architecture of a large series of real pollination (mutualistic) and herbivory (trophic) networks. We conclude that strong variations in the stability of architectural patterns constrain ecological networks toward different architectures, depending on the type of interaction.
Ecological network architecture differs between models of trophic (herbivore) and mutualistic (pollination) communities.

	abstract = {Understanding the fundamental laws that govern complex food web networks over large ecosystems presents high costs and oftentimes unsurmountable logistical challenges. This way, it is crucial to find smaller systems that can be used as proxy food webs. Intertidal rock pool environments harbour particularly high biodiversity over small areas. This study aimed to analyse their food web networks to investigate their potential as proxies of larger ecosystems for food web networks research. Highly resolved food webs were compiled for 116 intertidal rock pools from cold, temperate, subtropical and tropical regions, to ensure a wide representation of environmental variability. The network properties of these food webs were compared to that of estuaries, lakes and rivers, as well as marine and terrestrial ecosystems (46 previously published complex food webs). The intertidal rock pool food webs analysed presented properties that were in the same range as the previously published food webs. The niche model predictive success was remarkably high (73–88\%) and similar to that previously found for much larger marine and terrestrial food webs. By using a large-scale sampling effort covering 116 intertidal rock pools in several biogeographic regions, this study showed, for the first time, that intertidal rock pools encompass food webs that share fundamental organizational characteristics with food webs from markedly different, larger, open and abiotically stable ecosystems. As small, self-contained habitats, intertidal rock pools are particularly tractable systems and therefore a large number of food webs can be examined with relatively low sampling effort. This study shows, for the first time that they can be useful models for the understanding of universal processes that regulate the complex network organization of food webs, which are harder or impossible to investigate in larger, open ecosystems, due to high costs and logistical difficulties.},

Conditional autoregressive (CAR) and simultaneous autoregressive (SAR) models are network-based models (also known as graphical models) specifically designed to model spatially autocorrelated data based on neighborhood relationships. We identify and discuss six different types of practical ecological inference using CAR and SAR models, including: (1) model selection, (2) spatial regression, (3) estimation of autocorrelation, (4) estimation of other connectivity parameters, (5) spatial prediction, and (6) spatial smoothing. We compare CAR and SAR models, showing their development and connection to partial correlations. Special cases, such as the intrinsic autoregressive model (IAR), are described. Conditional autoregressive and SAR models depend on weight matrices, whose practical development uses neighborhood definition and row-standardization. Weight matrices can also include ecological covariates and connectivity structures, which we emphasize, but have been rarely used. Trends in harbor seals (Phoca vitulina) in southeastern Alaska from 463 polygons, some with missing data, are used to illustrate the six inference types. We develop a variety of weight matrices and CAR and SAR spatial regression models are fit using maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods. Profile likelihood graphs illustrate inference for covariance parameters. The same data set is used for both prediction and smoothing, and the relative merits of each are discussed. We show the nonstationary variances and correlations of a CAR model and demonstrate the effect of row-standardization. We include several take-home messages for CAR and SAR models, including (1) choosing between CAR and IAR models, (2) modeling ecological effects in the covariance matrix, (3) the appeal of spatial smoothing, and (4) how to handle isolated neighbors. We highlight several reasons why ecologists will want to make use of autoregressive models, both directly and in hierarchical models, and not only in explicit spatial settings, but also for more general connectivity models.},

It is used to refer to research outputs as well as researchers, theory and education, individuals and organizations, from art history to zoology. But does “excellence” actually mean anything? Does this pervasive narrative of “excellence” do any good? Drawing on a range of sources we interrogate “excellence” as a concept and find that it has no intrinsic meaning in academia. Rather it functions as a linguistic interchange mechanism. To investigate whether this linguistic function is useful we examine how the rhetoric of excellence combines with narratives of scarcity and competition to show that the hyper-competition that arises from the performance of “excellence” is completely at odds with the qualities of good research. We trace the roots of issues in reproducibility, fraud, and homophily to this rhetoric. But we also show that this rhetoric is an internal, and not primarily an external, imposition. We conclude by proposing an alternative rhetoric based on soundness and capacity-building. In the final analysis, it turns out that that “excellence” is not excellent. Used in its current unqualified form it is a pernicious and dangerous rhetoric that undermines the very foundations of good research and scholarship.

	abstract = {Global change is modifying species communities from local to landscape scales, with alterations in the abiotic and biotic determinants of geographic range limits causing species range shifts along both latitudinal and elevational gradients. An important but often overlooked component of global change is the effect of anthropogenic disturbance, and how it interacts with the effects of climate to affect both species and communities, as well as interspecies interactions, such as facilitation and competition. We examined the effects of frequent human trampling disturbances on alpine plant communities in Switzerland, focusing on the elevational range of the widely distributed cushion plant Silene acaulis and the interactions of this facilitator species with other plants. Examining size distributions and densities, we found that disturbance appears to favor individual Silene growth at middle elevations. However, it has negative effects at the population level, as evidenced by a reduction in population density and reproductive indices. Disturbance synergistically interacts with the effects of elevation to reduce species richness at low and high elevations, an effect not mitigated by Silene. In fact, we find predominantly competitive interactions, both by Silene on its hosted and neighboring species and by neighboring (but not hosted) species on Silene. Our results indicate that disturbance can be beneficial for Silene individual performance, potentially through changes in its neighboring species community. However, possible reduced recruitment in disturbed areas could eventually lead to population declines. While other studies have shown that light to moderate disturbances can maintain high species diversity, our results emphasize that heavier disturbance reduces species richness, diversity, as well as percent cover, and adversely affects cushion plants and that these effects are not substantially reduced by plant–plant interactions. Heavily disturbed alpine systems could therefore be at greater risk for upward encroachment of lower elevation species in a warming world.},

We used an individual-based model to demonstrate that plant facilitation on a microscale may cause ecosystem shifts on a landscape scale that can be announced by generic earlywarning indicators. Recruitment of woody plants in harsh environments such as drylands often depends on nurse plants that ameliorate stressful conditions and facilitate the establishment of seedlings under their canopy. We found that these facilitative interactions may cause a treeless and a woodland state to be alternative stable states on a landscape scale if nurse plant effects are strong and if the environment is harsh enough to make facilitation necessary for seedling survival. A corollary is that under such conditions environmental change can bring drylands to tipping points for woody plant encroachment or woodland collapse. We show that the proximity of tipping points may be indicated by slowness of recovery of woody vegetation cover from small perturbations as well as by elevated temporal and spatial autocorrelation and variance. These signs are known to be indicators of critical slowing down. This is the ﬁrst demonstration that the systemic phenomena of tipping points, announced by critical slowing down as a warning signal, may plausibly arise from microscale individual interactions, such as plant facilitation.},

	abstract = {Food chain theory is one of the cornerstones of ecology, providing many of its basic predictions, such as bottom-up and top-down control, biomass pyramids, trophic cascades and predator-prey oscillations. Yet, ninety years into this theory, the precise conditions under which these patterns may occur and persist in Nature remain subject to debate. Rather than address each pattern in isolation, we propose that they must be understood together, calling for the synthesis of a fragmented set of theories and empirical results. To do this, we propose a minimal theory that combines the energetic and dynamical approaches to food chains. We chart its predictions on a concise map, where two main regimes emerge: one regime characterized by pyramidal patterns, the other by cascade patterns, across a diversity of functioning and stability metrics. The axes of this map are governed by essential physiological and ecological variables, such as metabolic rates and self-regulation. A quantitative comparison with data sheds light on conflicting theoretical predictions and empirical puzzles, from inverted size spectra to causes of trophic cascade strength. We conclude that drawing systematic connections between stability and functioning properties is a necessary step toward testing food chain theory as a reliable description of real ecosystems.},

It is the preferred destination of many herds disturbing local ecosystems and loosing many palatable plant species. These climatic stresses and human disturbances affect the local natural vegetation communities. Conservation management has been imposed in order to preserve the national floristic heritage and biodiversity. Among the proposed techniques was the creation of Sidi Toui national park since 1991. This study aims to assess changes of flora life forms strategies (Raunkiaer, Noy-Meir and Grime types) inside and outside the park from 1990 to 2011. The Raunkiaer biologic spectrum is considered as a flora adaptation strategy to the climatic conditions. Noy-Meir classified plants on the basis of their photosynthetic activity during the dry season (arido-passive and arido-active species).

Main results are (i) Chameaphytes and Hemicryptophytes cover increased at the beginning and decreased after long period of protection, (ii) Therophytes dominate inside the park after 20 years of protection, (iii) Arido-active species are sensible to human disturbance and long protection effects and (iv) the protection period decreased the cover of S, CS and CRS species and increased the RS ones.

	abstract = {There is an ongoing debate about whether communities are closely integrated and bound together via interactions such as competition or facilitation, or are disintegrated and dominated by chance. We still lack community-wide data on the intensities of interactions and randomness, and measurements of their impacts on community structure. Using a long-term data set, we sought to measure the effects of interactions and stochasticity in structuring a highly diverse ({\textgreater}100 species) semi-arid grassland plant community, testing for positive and negative interactions at different stages of population growth of all species. During the colonization of new patches, most species were facilitated or inhibited by several others. These opposite effects can potentially have a large effect on species abundances, but they were correlated and cancelled out at the community level. Nevertheless, competition during colonization was strong enough to cause poor competitors to have small population sizes. The subsequent phase of population growth (increase and subsequent change in numbers within occupied patches) was mainly driven by intraspecific density dependence, and we found little evidence for interspecific interactions. Model results showed that stochasticity and recurrent colonization of transient, favourable patches maintained diversity, keeping poor competitors from becoming extinct. Synthesis: Our results, taken together with recent studies on tropical forests, suggest that weak interactions among established plants may be a general phenomenon, but that local interactions during colonization are important drivers of community composition. Most of the variance in species abundance in our community was explained by intraspecific competition and stochasticity, with interspecific interactions playing a minor role due to their overall weakness, interaction changes over ontogeny, and the cancellation of opposite-sign interactions when all the species in the community are considered. Despite this, some species were rare seemingly because they cannot withstand interspecific competition. Thus, to untangle the effects of interactions on community structure, future research should focus on interactions occurring at different phases of population growth and on whole communities.},

	abstract = {Understanding the role of competition in structuring communities requires that we quantify competitive ability in a way that permits us to predict the outcome of competition over the long term. Given such a clear goal for a process that has been the focus of ecological research for decades, there is surprisingly little consensus on how to measure competitive ability, with up to 50 different metrics currently proposed. Using competitive population dynamics as a foundation, we define competitive ability—the ability of one species to exclude another—using quantitative theoretical models of population dynamics to isolate the key parameters that are known to predict competitive outcomes. Based on the definition of competitive ability we identify the empirical requirements and describe straightforward methods for quantifying competitive ability in future empirical studies. In doing so, our analysis also allows us to identify why many existing approaches to studying competition are unsuitable for quantifying competitive ability. Synthesis. Competitive ability is precisely defined starting from models of competitive population dynamics. Quantifying competitive ability in a theoretically justified manner is straightforward using experimental designs readily applied to studies of competition in the laboratory and field.},

Progress requires determining which processes and species differences are most important for coexistence when multiple processes operate and species differ in many ways. Modern coexistence theory (MCT), formalised by Chesson, holds out the promise of doing that, but empirical applications remain scarce. We argue that MCT’s mathematical complexity and subtlety have obscured the simplicity and power of its underlying ideas and hindered applications. We present a general computational approach that extends our previous solution for the storage effect to all of standard MCT’s spatial and temporal coexistence mechanisms, and also process-deﬁned mechanisms amenable to direct study such as resource partitioning, indirect competition, and life history trade-offs. The main components are a method to partition population growth rates into contributions from different mechanisms and their interactions, and numerical calculations in which some mechanisms are removed and others retained. We illustrate how our approach handles features that have not been analysed in the standard framework through several case studies: competing diatom species under ﬂuctuating temperature, plant–soil feedbacks in grasslands, facilitation in a beach grass community, and niche differences with independent effects on recruitment, survival and growth in sagebrush steppe.},

Although metacommunity theory has considered trophic dynamics in the past, it has been performed idiosyncratically with a wide selection of possible dynamics. Trophic metacommunity theory needs a synthesis of a few influential axis to simplify future predictions and tests. We propose an extension of metacommunity ecology that addresses these shortcomings by incorporating variability among trophic levels in ‘spatial use properties’. We define ‘spatial use properties’ as a set of traits (dispersal, migration, foraging and spatial information processing) that set the spatial and temporal scales of organismal movement, and thus scales of interspecific interactions. Progress towards a synthetic predictive framework can be made by (1) documenting patterns of spatial use properties in natural food webs and (2) using theory and experiments to test how trophic structure in spatial use properties affects metacommunity dynamics.},

One way to tell is to compare total species counts in geographic regions to average counts in ecological samples falling within those regions. If species richness is limited regionally, then the relationship should be curvilinear even in a log-log space. Global sets of samples including trees and 10 groups of animals are analysed to test this hypothesis. Most relationships are indeed curvilinear. To explain these patterns, a simple model is proposed that invokes biotic interaction-limited speciation or immigration rates combined with extinction or extirpation rates that fall as the number of occupied patches increases. Local and regional richness come into balance as the rates trade off, causing global richness to also be limited. Surprisingly, however, the data for trees break the pattern, suggesting that the great adaptive radiation of seed plants may still be unfolding.},

However, it is unclear whether and when size-dependent responses to exogenous environmental ﬂuctuations affect population dynamics. Size-by-environment interactions create pathways for environmental ﬂuctuations to inﬂuence population dynamics by allowing for negative covariation between sizes within vital rates (e.g. small and large individuals have negatively covarying survival rates) and/or size-dependent variability in a vital rate (e.g. survival of large individuals varies less than small individuals through time). Whether these phenomena affect population dynamics depends on how they are mediated by elasticities (they must affect the sizes and vital rates that matter) and their projected impacts will depend on model functional form (the impact of reduced variance depends on the relationship between the environment and vital rate). We demonstrate these ideas with an analysis of ﬁfteen species from ﬁve semiarid plant communities. We ﬁnd that size-by-environment interactions are common but do not impact long-term population dynamics. Size-by-environment interactions may yet be important for other species. Our approach can be applied to species in other ecosystems to determine if and how size-by-environment interactions allow them to cope with, or exploit, ﬂuctuating environments.},

	abstract = {Uncovering the roles of biotic interactions in assembling and maintaining species-rich communities remains a major challenge in ecology. In plant communities, interactions between individuals of different species are expected to generate positive or negative spatial interspecific associations over short distances. Recent studies using individual-based point pattern datasets have concluded that (a) detectable interspecific interactions are generally rare, but (b) are most common in communities with fewer species; and (c) the most abundant species tend to have the highest frequency of interactions. However, it is unclear how the detection of spatial interactions may change with the abundances of each species, or the scale and intensity of interactions. We ask if statistical power is sufficient to explain all three key results. We use a simple two-species model, assuming no habitat associations, and where the abundances, scale and intensity of interactions are controlled to simulate point pattern data. In combination with an approximation to the variance of the spatial summary statistics that we sample, we investigate the power of current spatial point pattern methods to correctly reject the null model of pairwise species independence. We show the power to detect interactions is positively related to both the abundances of the species tested, and the intensity and scale of interactions, but negatively related to imbalance in abundances. Differences in detection power in combination with the abundance distributions found in natural communities are sufficient to explain all the three key empirical results, even if all pairwise interactions are identical. Critically, many hundreds of individuals of both species may be required to detect even intense interactions, implying current abundance thresholds for including species in the analyses are too low. Synthesis. The widespread failure to reject the null model of spatial interspecific independence could be due to low power of the tests rather than any key biological process. Since we do not model habitat associations, our results represent a first step in quantifying sample sizes required to make strong statements about the role of biotic interactions in diverse plant communities. However, power should be factored into analyses and considered when designing empirical studies.},

Here, we review what is known about the mechanistic basis for nine factors proposed to predict phenological change (latitude, elevation, habitat type, trophic level, migratory strategy, ecological specialization, species’ seasonality, thermoregulatory mode, and generation time). We find that many studies either do not identify a specific underlying mechanism or do not evaluate alternative mechanistic hypotheses, limiting the ability of scientists to predict future responses to global change with accuracy. We present a conceptual framework that emphasizes a critical distinction between environmental (cue-driven) and organismal (response-driven) mechanisms causing variation in phenological shifts and discuss how this distinction can reduce confusion in the field and improve predictions of future phenological change.},

We used these data and a null model to determine whether bee species’ foraging choices varied more or less over time beyond the variation expected by chance. Thus we provide the first quantitative definition of rewiring and fidelity as these terms are used in the literature on interaction networks. All 52 bee species varied in plant partner choice across years, but for 27 species this variation was indistinguishable from random partner choice. Another 11 species showed rewiring, varying more across years than expected by chance, while 14 species showed fidelity, indicating that they both prefer certain plant species and are consistent in those preferences across years. Our study shows that rewiring and fidelity both exist in mutualist networks, but that once sampling effects have been accounted for, they are less common than has been reported in the ecological literature.},

Organisms often have smaller body sizes under warmer climates (Bergmann’s rule and the temperature-size rule), and body size is a major determinant of life histories, demography, population size, nutrient turnover rate, and food-web structure. Therefore, by altering body sizes in whole communities, current warming can potentially disrupt ecosystem function and services. However, the underlying drivers of warming-induced body downsizing remain far from clear. Here, we show that thermal clines in body size are predicted from universal laws of ecology and metabolism, so that size-dependent selection from competition (both intra and interspeciﬁc) and predation favors smaller individuals under warmer conditions. We validate this prediction using 4.1 9 106 individual body size measurements from French river ﬁsh spanning 29 years and 52 species. Our results suggest that warming-induced body downsizing is an emergent property of size-structured food webs, and highlight the need to consider trophic interactions when predicting biosphere reorganizations under global warming.},

	abstract = {The local extinction or large fluctuation in abundance of a species may seriously affect other species in the community. The effects spread through the community by direct and indirect interactions. The network perspective on ecology can help map the pathways of these effects, for food webs, the pathways of indirect trophic interactions. Indirect interactions typically decay in intensity as they spread. Therefore, there is a conceptual maximum range in topological space beyond which interactions have no effects, even though all species remain connected. Neither the local characteristics of species, nor the global characteristics of entire webs, suitably quantify this range. We therefore apply intermediate scale indices that reflect the limitations imposed by effect damping in networks. We present a complex analysis of the topological positional importance of species in the Chesapeake Bay web. This web is a carbon-flow network that represents trophic interactions. We present several different indices reflecting different properties and discuss which questions the different indices best answer. We look for the best indices for identifying the key players in ecosystem functioning. Our study contributes to the quantification of relative species importance and provides an exact and a priori determination of a class of candidate keystone species that can inform applied and conservation ecology as well as theoretical concerns.},

This hypothesis, however, is unrealistic because it ignores the forces that contribute to synchronization of population dynamics. Here we present a mechanistic neutral model that describes the dynamics of a community of equivalent species under the joint influence of density dependence, environmental forcing, and demographic stochasticity. We also introduce a new standardized measure of species synchrony in multispecies communities. We show that the per capita population growth rates of equivalent species are strongly synchronized, especially when endogenous population dynamics are cyclic or chaotic, while their long‐term fluctuations in population sizes are desynchronized by ecological drift. We then generalize our model to nonneutral dynamics by incorporating temporal and nontemporal forms of niche differentiation. Niche differentiation consistently decreases the synchrony of species per capita population growth rates, while its effects on the synchrony of population sizes are more complex. Comparing the observed synchrony of species per capita population growth rates with that predicted by the neutral model potentially provides a simple test of deterministic asynchrony in a community.},

Although biodiversity is now known to affect ecosystem productivity1,2,3,4,5,6, its effects on stability are debated6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13. Here we present a long-term experimental field test of the diversity–stability hypothesis. During a decade of data collection in an experiment that directly controlled the number of perennial prairie species4, growing-season climate varied considerably, causing year-to-year variation in abundances of plant species and in ecosystem productivity. We found that greater numbers of plant species led to greater temporal stability of ecosystem annual aboveground plant production. In particular, the decadal temporal stability of the ecosystem, whether measured with intervals of two, five or ten years, was significantly greater at higher plant diversity and tended to increase as plots matured. Ecosystem stability was also positively dependent on root mass, which is a measure of perenniating biomass. Temporal stability of the ecosystem increased with diversity, despite a lower temporal stability of individual species, because of both portfolio (statistical averaging) and overyielding effects. However, we found no evidence of a covariance effect. Our results indicate that the reliable, efficient and sustainable supply of some foods (for example, livestock fodder), biofuels and ecosystem services can be enhanced by the use of biodiversity.},

	abstract = {The assessment of climate change impacts on biodiversity has so far been biased toward the taxonomic identification of the species likely either to benefit from climate modifications or to experience overall declines. There have still been few studies intended to correlate the characteristics of species to their sensitivity to climate change, even though it is now recognized that functional trait-based approaches are promising tools for addressing challenges related to global changes. In this study, two functional indices (originality and uniqueness) were first measured for 35 fish species occurring in French streams. They were then combined to projections of range shifts in response to climate change derived from species distribution models. We set out to investigate: (1) the relationship between the degrees of originality and uniqueness of fish species, and their projected response to future climate change; and (2) the consequences of individual responses of species for the functional diversity of fish assemblages. After accounting for phylogenetic relatedness among species, we have demonstrated that the two indices used measure two complementary facets of the position of fish species in a functional space. We have also rejected the hypothesis that the most original and/or less redundant species would necessarily experience the greatest declines in habitat suitability as a result of climate change. However, individual species range shifts could lead simultaneously both to a severe decline in the functional diversity of fish assemblages, and to an increase in the functional similarity among assemblages, supporting the hypothesis that disturbance favors communities with combination of common traits and biotic homogenization as well. Our findings therefore emphasize the importance of going beyond the simple taxonomic description of diversity to provide a better assessment of the likely future effects of environmental changes on biodiversity, thus helping to design more effective conservation and management measures.},

Understanding how those diversity facets are distributed and what are their determinants has become a central concern in the current context of biodiversity crisis, but such multi-faceted measures over large geographical areas are still pending. Here, we measured the congruence between the biogeographical patterns of freshwater fish morphological, ecological and phylogenetic diversity across Europe and identified the natural and anthropogenic drivers shaping those patterns. Based on freshwater fish occurrence records in 290 European river catchments, we computed richness and evenness for morphological, ecological and phylogenetic diversity using standardized effect sizes for each diversity index. We then used linear models including climatic, geo-morphological, biotic and human-related factors to determine the key drivers shaping freshwater fish biodiversity patterns across Europe. We found a weak spatial congruence between facets of diversity. Patterns of diversity were mainly driven by elevation range, climatic seasonality and species richness while other factors played a minor role. Finally, we found that non-native species introductions significantly affected diversity patterns and influenced the effects of some environmental drivers. Morphological, ecological and phylogenetic diversity constitute complementary facets of fish diversity rather than surrogates, testifying that they deserve to be considered altogether to properly assess biodiversity. Although the same environmental and anthropogenic factors overall explained those diversity facets, their relative influence varied. In the current context of global change, non-native species introductions may also lead to important reshuffling of assemblages resulting in profound changes of diversity patterns.},

We disentangled the effects of local (limiting similarity and habitat filtering) and regional processes (biogeography, history and geographical constraints) on the species and phylogenetic diversity of native riverine fish communities across France. Fish species richness (SR), phylogenetic diversity (estimated as the phylogenetic species variability metric, PSV) and trait evenness (estimated from 17 ecological and life-history traits) were estimated for fish at 932 sampling sites across 42 river basins in France. A phylogenetic signal in traits and species responses to environment variation were estimated using linear models. Null models were developed to test whether river basins constrain the PSV of the communities. Hierarchical linear models were fitted to PSV and SR to partition the variance explained by local and regional processes. Fish species richness and phylogenetic diversity were negatively correlated across sites (r = −0.589, P {\textless} 0 001). There was a phylogenetic signal in species traits, but only a weak signal in species responses to environmental variation across sites. The null models suggested that river basins constrain community PSV. Local-scale predictors (temperature, landscape position and trait evenness) explained the variation in both PSV and SR, while regional-scale predictors (latitude, longitude and basin surface area) explained the variation only in SR. Significant interaction terms between local- and regional-scale predictors were also detected for both metrics. Local-scale processes, habitat filtering and limiting similarity, probably determine the species composition of fish communities across France, while broad-scale, regional processes constrain community composition both directly and indirectly by affecting the strength of these local-scale processes. By analysing phylogenetic diversity and species richness simultaneously, a full picture of the drivers of local-scale diversity can be determined.},

The Neotropical realm hosts more than 75\% of global functional diversity while other realms each host less than 25\%. This discrepancy is mediated by high functional uniqueness in some diversified Neotropical fish orders. Surprisingly, functional diversity patterns were weakly related to functional vulnerability. In the Neotropics the loss of threatened species will cause a limited loss of functional diversity ({\textless}10\%) whereas in the Nearctic and Palearctic realms, decline of the functional diversity will reach 43\% and 33\%, respectively, conferring a high functional vulnerability to these realms.

For example, the theory of punctuated equilibrium proposes that phenotypic change typically occurs in rapid bursts associated with speciation events. However, recent phylogenetic studies have found little evidence linking these processes in nature. Here we demonstrate that rates of species diversification are highly correlated with the rate of body size evolution across the 30,000+ living species of ray-finned fishes that comprise the majority of vertebrate biological diversity. This coupling is a general feature of fish evolution and transcends vast differences in ecology and body-plan organization. Our results may reflect a widespread speciational mode of character change in living fishes. Alternatively, these findings are consistent with the hypothesis that phenotypic ‘evolvability’—the capacity of organisms to evolve—shapes the dynamics of speciation through time at the largest phylogenetic scales.},

	abstract = {Of all ecosystems, freshwaters support the most dynamic and highly concentrated biodiversity on Earth. These attributes of freshwater biodiversity along with increasing demand for water mean that these systems serve as signiﬁcant models to understand drivers of global biodiversity change. Freshwater biodiversity changes are often attributed to hydrological alteration by water-resource development and climate change owing to the role of the hydrological regime of rivers, wetlands and ﬂoodplains affecting patterns of biodiversity. However, a major gap remains in conceptualising how the hydrological regime determines patterns in biodiversity’s multiple spatial components and facets (taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic). We synthesised primary evidence of freshwater biodiversity responses to natural hydrological regimes to determine how distinct ecohydrological mechanisms affect freshwater biodiversity at local, landscape and regional spatial scales. Hydrological connectivity inﬂuences local and landscape biodiversity, yet responses vary depending on spatial scale. Biodiversity at local scales is generally positively associated with increasing connectivity whereas landscape-scale biodiversity is greater with increasing fragmentation among locations. The effects of hydrological disturbance on freshwater biodiversity are variable at separate spatial scales and depend on disturbance frequency and history and organism characteristics. The role of hydrology in determining habitat for freshwater biodiversity also depends on spatial scaling. At local scales, persistence, stability and size of habitat each contribute to patterns of freshwater biodiversity yet the responses are variable across the organism groups that constitute overall freshwater biodiversity. We present a conceptual model to unite the effects of different ecohydrological mechanisms on freshwater biodiversity across spatial scales, and develop four principles for applying a multi-scaled understanding of freshwater biodiversity responses to hydrological regimes. The protection and restoration of freshwater biodiversity is both a fundamental justiﬁcation and a central goal of environmental water allocation worldwide. Clearer integration of concepts of spatial scaling in the context of understanding impacts of hydrological regimes on biodiversity will increase uptake of evidence into environmental ﬂow implementation, identify suitable biodiversity targets responsive to hydrological change or restoration, and identify and manage risks of environmental ﬂows contributing to biodiversity decline.},

	abstract = {1. Understanding the structure of ecological networks is a crucial task for interpreting community and ecosystem responses to global change. 2. Despite the recent interest in this subject, almost all studies have focused exclusively on one specific network property. The question remains as to what extent different network properties are related and how understanding this relationship can advance our comprehension of the mechanisms behind these patterns. 3. Here, we analysed the relationship between nestedness and modularity, two frequently studied network properties, for a large data set of 95 ecological communities including both plant–animal mutualistic and host–parasite networks. 4. We found that the correlation between nestedness and modularity for a population of random matrices generated from the real communities decreases significantly in magnitude and sign with increasing connectance independent of the network type. At low connectivities, networks that are highly nested also tend to be highly modular; the reverse happens at high connectivities. 5. The above result is qualitatively robust when different null models are used to infer network structure, but, at a finer scale, quantitative differences exist. We observed an important interaction between the network structure pattern and the null model used to detect it. 6. A better understanding of the relationship between nestedness and modularity is important given their potential implications on the dynamics and stability of ecological communities.},

To avoid misinterpretation, existing definitions of alpha and beta must be replaced by a definition that partitions diversity into independent alpha and beta components. Such a unique definition is derived here. When these new alpha and beta components are transformed into their numbers equivalents (effective numbers of elements), Whittaker's multiplicative law (alpha × beta = gamma) is necessarily true for all indices. The new beta gives the effective number of distinct communities. The most popular similarity and overlap measures of ecology (Jaccard, Sorensen, Horn, and Morisita-Horn indices) are monotonic transformations of the new beta diversity. Shannon measures follow deductively from this formalism and do not need to be borrowed from information theory; they are shown to be the only standard diversity measures which can be decomposed into meaningful independent alpha and beta components when community weights are unequal.},

	abstract = {Aims Despite wide consensus that ecological patterns and processes should be studied at multiple spatial scales, the temporal component of diversity variation has remained poorly examined. Specifically, rare species may exhibit patterns of diversity variation profoundly different from those of dominant taxa. Location Southern Finland. Methods We used multiplicative partitioning of true diversities (species richness, Shannon diversity) to identify the most important scale(s) of variation of benthic macroinvertebrate communities across several hierarchical scales, from individual samples to multiple littorals, lakes and years. We also assessed the among-scale variability of benthic macroinvertebrate community composition by using measures of between- and within-group distances at hierarchical scales. Results On average, a single benthic sample contained 23\% of the total regional macroinvertebrate species pool. For both species richness and Shannon diversity, beta-diversity was clearly the major component of regional diversity, with within-littoral beta-diversity (β1) being the largest component of gamma-diversity. The interannual component of total diversity was small, being almost negligible for Shannon index. Among-sample (within-littoral) diversity was related to variation of substratum heterogeneity at the same scale. By contrast, only a small proportion of rare taxa was found in an average benthic sample. Thus, dominant species among lakes and years were about the same, whereas rare species were mostly detected in a few benthic samples in one lake (or year). For rare species, the temporal component of diversity was more important than spatial turnover at most scales. Main conclusions While individual species occurrences and abundances, particularly those of rare taxa, may vary strongly through space and time, patterns of dominance in lake littoral benthic communities are highly predictable. Consequently, many rare species will be missed in temporally restricted samples of lake littorals. In comprehensive biodiversity surveys, interannual sampling of littoral macroinvertebrate communities is therefore needed.},

	abstract = {Within food webs, species can be partitioned into groups according to various criteria. Two notions have received particular attention: trophic groups (TGs), which have been used for decades in the ecological literature, and more recently, modules. The relationship between these two group concepts remains unknown in empirical food webs. While recent developments in network theory have led to efficient methods for detecting modules in food webs, the determination of TGs (groups of species that are functionally similar) is largely based on subjective expert knowledge. We develop a novel algorithm for TG detection. We apply this method to empirical food webs and show that aggregation into TGs allows for the simplification of food webs while preserving their information content. Furthermore, we reveal a two-level hierarchical structure where modules partition food webs into large bottom–top trophic pathways, whereas TGs further partition these pathways into groups of species with similar trophic connections. This provides new perspectives for the study of dynamical and functional consequences of food-web structure, bridging topological and dynamical analysis. TGs have a clear ecological meaning and are found to provide a trade-off between network complexity and information loss.},

	abstract = {Temporal variation in the composition of species assemblages could be the result of deterministic processes driven by environmental change and/or stochastic processes of colonization and local extinction. Here, we analyzed the relative roles of deterministic and stochastic processes on bird assemblages in an agricultural landscape of southwestern France. We first assessed the impact of land cover change that occurred between 1982 and 2007 on (i) the species composition (presence/absence) of bird assemblages and (ii) the spatial pattern of taxonomic beta diversity. We also compared the observed temporal change of bird assemblages with a null model accounting for the effect of stochastic dynamics on temporal beta diversity. Temporal assemblage dissimilarity was partitioned into two separate components, accounting for the replacement of species (i.e. turnover) and for the nested species losses (or gains) from one time to the other (i.e. nestedness-resultant dissimilarity), respectively. Neither the turnover nor the nestedness-resultant components of temporal variation were accurately explained by any of the measured variables accounting for land cover change (r2{\textless}0.06 in all cases). Additionally, the amount of spatial assemblage heterogeneity in the region did not significantly change between 1982 and 2007, and site-specific observed temporal dissimilarities were larger than null expectations in only 1\% of sites for temporal turnover and 13\% of sites for nestedness-resultant dissimilarity. Taken together, our results suggest that land cover change in this agricultural landscape had little impact on temporal beta diversity of bird assemblages. Although other unmeasured deterministic process could be driving the observed patterns, it is also possible that the observed changes in presence/absence species composition of local bird assemblages might be the consequence of stochastic processes in which species populations appeared and disappeared from specific localities in a random-like way. Our results might be case-specific, but if stochastic dynamics are generally dominant, the ability of correlative and mechanistic models to predict land cover change effects on species composition would be compromised.},

However, the knowledge is limited for the association between spatial turnover and temporal turnover. Here, we performed two investigations of the phytoplankton composition in the lakes of the Yangtze River catchment in China in the spring and summer of 2012, which covered regional spatial scale and two-season temporal scale. We analysed the association between temporal and spatial species turnover in phytoplankton. The results showed that 1) the two-season temporal turnover of phytoplankton varied based on the mean values and the coefficient of variance of environmental variables, and pH was the most important variable negatively affecting the temporal turnover; 2) the spatial beta diversity of phytoplankton in summer was higher than that in spring, and the distance decay pattern was significant in summer, but not in spring; 3) the variation in spatial turnover in spring and summer was attributed to the primary environmental variables (nitrogen, phosphorus and underwater available light) and broader-scale spatial variables; 4) the proportion of jointly explained variation of spatial Bray–Curtis dissimilarity by the environment and space increased from 38\% (spring) to 55\% (summer), which was mainly due to the variation in spatially structured environmental variables during the two-season temporal turnover, such as pH and ion concentrations; 5) the community compositions in summer were more similar between the lakes with similar two-season temporal turnover. These results indicate that the spatial turnover of phytoplankton composition in summer was partially predetermined by the variation in environmental variables and phytoplankton composition during the process of two-season temporal turnover, and highlight the understanding of temporal variations in spatial beta diversity as well as the underlying assembly mechanisms in phytoplankton.},

Although there are thirteen possible configurations of three species subgraphs, some are consistently over-represented in empirical food webs. This is a robust pattern that is found across marine, freshwater or terrestrial environments. The preferential elimination of unstable subgraphs during the assembly of the food web can explain the observed pattern. It follows from this hypothesis that there should be differences in the stability of different subgraphs, and that stability should be positively correlated to their frequency in food webs. Using 50 food webs collected from a variety of databases I determined the frequency of each of the thirteen possible subgraphs with respect to randomized webs. Then by numerical simulation I determined the quasi sign stability (QSS) of each subgraph. My results clearly show a positive correlation between QSS and over-representation of the different subgraphs in empirical food webs.},

This issue — commonly referred to as the diversity–stability debate — is the subject of this review, which synthesizes historical ideas with recent advances. Both theory and empirical evidence agree that we should expect declines in diversity to accelerate the simplification of ecological communities.},

	abstract = {Abstract.— We study the spatial adaptive dynamics of a continuous trait that measures individual investment in altruism. Our study is based on an ecological model of a spatially heterogeneous population from which we derive an appropriate measure of fitness. The analysis of this fitness measure uncovers three different selective processes controlling the evolution of altruism: the direct physiological cost, the indirect genetic benefits of cooperative interactions, and the indirect genetic costs of competition for space. In our model, habitat structure and a continuous life cycle makes the cost of competing for space with relatives negligible. Our study yields a classification of adaptive patterns of altruism according to the shape of the costs of altruism (with decelerating, linear, or accelerating dependence on the investment in altruism). The invasion of altruism occurs readily in species with accelerating costs, but large mutations are critical for altruism to evolve in selfish species with decelerating costs. Strict selfishness is maintained by natural selection only under very restricted conditions. In species with rapidly accelerating costs, adaptation leads to an evolutionarily stable rate of investment in altruism that decreases smoothly with the level of mobility. A rather different adaptive pattern emerges in species with slowly accelerating costs: high altruism evolves at low mobility, whereas a quasi-selfish state is promoted in more mobile species. The high adaptive level of altruism can be predicted solely from habitat connectedness and physiological parameters that characterize the pattern of cost. We also show that environmental changes that cause increased mobility in those highly altruistic species can beget selection-driven self-extinction, which may contribute to the rarity of social species.},

The complexity of empirical food webs, however, is leading many ecologists to focus dynamic ecosystem studies on smaller microcosm or mesocosm studies based upon community modules, which comprise three to five species and the interactions likely to have ecological relevance. We provide here a structural counterpart to community modules. We investigate food-web ‘motifs’ which are n-species connected subgraphs found within the food web. Remarkably, we find that the over- and under-representation of three-species motifs in empirical food webs can be understood through comparison to a static food-web model, the niche model. Our result conclusively demonstrates that predation upon species with some ‘characteristic’ niche value is the prey selection mechanism consistent with the structural properties of empirical food webs.},

The integration of biogeography and network theory will yield important results and further our understanding of species interactions. It has, however, been hampered so far by the difficulty to quantify variation among interaction networks. Here, we propose a general framework to study the dissimilarity of species interaction networks over time, space or environments, allowing both the use of quantitative and qualitative data. We decompose network dissimilarity into interactions and species turnover components, so that it is immediately comparable to common measures of β-diversity. We emphasise that scaling up β-diversity of community composition to the β-diversity of interactions requires only a small methodological step, which we foresee will help empiricists adopt this method. We illustrate the framework with a large dataset of hosts and parasites interactions and highlight other possible usages. We discuss a research agenda towards a biogeographical theory of species interactions.},

We ﬁnd that species occupy highly dynamic network positions through time, causing the assembly process to be punctuated by major network reorganisations. The most persistent pollinator species are also the most variable in their network positions, contrary to what preferential attachment –the most widely studied theory of ecological network assembly – predicts. Instead, we suggest assembly occurs via an opportunistic attachment process. Our results contribute to our understanding of how communities assembly and how species interactions change through time while helping to inform efforts to reassemble robust communities.},

How biodiversity interacts with ecosystem stability and productivity is key to understanding the impacts of environmental changes on ecosystem functions. In a series of decade-long experiments in temperate grassland, Hautier et al. manipulated nitrogen, water, carbon dioxide, herbivory, and fire. In all cases, plant species diversity was important for preserving ecosystem function during environmental change. Hence, the preservation and restoration of biodiversity buffer ecosystems against anthropogenic assault.
Science, this issue p. 336
Human-driven environmental changes may simultaneously affect the biodiversity, productivity, and stability of Earth’s ecosystems, but there is no consensus on the causal relationships linking these variables. Data from 12 multiyear experiments that manipulate important anthropogenic drivers, including plant diversity, nitrogen, carbon dioxide, fire, herbivory, and water, show that each driver influences ecosystem productivity. However, the stability of ecosystem productivity is only changed by those drivers that alter biodiversity, with a given decrease in plant species numbers leading to a quantitatively similar decrease in ecosystem stability regardless of which driver caused the biodiversity loss. These results suggest that changes in biodiversity caused by drivers of environmental change may be a major factor determining how global environmental changes affect ecosystem stability.
Experiments in grassland show that ecosystem stability is affected more by changes in biodiversity than in productivity.

The relationship is also complex, because the concept of stability is multifaceted; different types of stability describing different properties of ecosystems lead to multiple diversity-stability relationships. A growing number of empirical studies demonstrate positive diversity-stability relationships. These studies, however, have emphasized only a few types of stability, and they rarely uncover the mechanisms responsible for stability. Because anthropogenic changes often affect stability and diversity simultaneously, diversity-stability relationships cannot be understood outside the context of the environmental drivers affecting both. This shifts attention away from diversity-stability relationships toward the multiple factors, including diversity, that dictate the stability of ecosystems.},

Here, we use a dynamical model of competitive metacommunities to study the relationships between species diversity and ecosystem variability across scales. We derive analytic relationships under a limiting case; these results are extended to more general cases with numerical simulations. Our model shows that, while alpha diversity decreases local ecosystem variability, beta diversity generally contributes to increasing spatial asynchrony among local ecosystems. Consequently, both alpha and beta diversity provide stabilising effects for regional ecosystems, through local and spatial insurance effects respectively. We further show that at the regional scale, the stabilising effect of biodiversity increases as spatial environmental correlation increases. Our findings have important implications for understanding the interactive effects of global environmental changes (e.g. environmental homogenisation) and biodiversity loss on ecosystem sustainability at large scales.},

However, empirical studies have stressed the complexity of natural food webs and the dominance of sigmoid or predator-interference functional responses, which may dampen population oscillations due to enrichment. Using analytical and numerical methods, we study enrichment effects on simple consumer-resource pairs and complex food webs with hyperbolic Holling type II (hereafter: type II), sigmoid Holling type III (hereafter: type III) and Beddington-De Angelis predator-interference functional responses (hereafter: BDA). Consumer-resource systems with a type III or BDA functional response are highly robust against accelerated oscillations due to enrichment, and the “paradox of enrichment” is resolved under certain parameter combinations. Subsequently, we simulated complex food webs with empirically-corroborated body-size structures of consumers that are ten times larger than their average resource. Our analyses demonstrate positive connectance-stability relationships with BDA or type III functional responses. Moreover, increasing connectance of these food webs also increases the robustness against enrichment in models with a BDA functional response. These results suggest that the well-known destabilising effects of connectance and enrichment found in classic models with type II functional responses may be inverted into stabilising effects in more realistic food-web models that are based on empirically-corroborated body-size structures and BDA or type III functional responses.},

Therefore, a better understanding of the evolution of plant defenses against their herbivores may be central for our understanding of tropical biodiversity. Here, we address the evolution of antiherbivore defenses and their possible contribution to coexistence in the Neotropical tree genus Inga (Fabaceae). Inga has {\textgreater}300 species, has radiated recently, and is frequently one of the most diverse and abundant genera at a given site. For 37 species from Panama and Peru we characterized developmental, ant, and chemical defenses against herbivores. We found extensive variation in defenses, but little evidence of phylogenetic signal. Furthermore, in a multivariate analysis, developmental, ant, and chemical defenses varied independently (were orthogonal) and appear to have evolved independently of each other. Our results are consistent with strong selection for divergent defensive traits, presumably mediated by herbivores. In an analysis of community assembly, we found that Inga species co-occurring as neighbors are more different in antiherbivore defenses than random, suggesting that possessing a rare defense phenotype increases fitness. These results imply that interactions with herbivores may be an important axis of niche differentiation that permits the coexistence of many species of Inga within a single site. Interactions between plants and their herbivores likely play a key role in the generation and maintenance of the conspicuously high plant diversity in the tropics.},

If there were n habitats, there could be up to n−1 internal equilibria with both species in addition to two single-species equilibria. These equilibria and their local stability can be calculated from a single function, indicating the difference among species in their average lifetime reproductive success. Our main result is that between-habitat variation in the ratio of mortalities of two species promotes coexistence, while that of reproductive rates does not. This conclusion is the opposite of the role of temporal variation in the standard lottery model, in which between-year variation in the reproductive rate, but not that in the mortalities, promotes coexistence.},

Yet, niche studies have been limited to describe coexistence within tropic levels despite incorporating information about multi-trophic interactions. Network approaches could address this limitation, but they have ignored the structure of species interactions within trophic levels. Here we call for the integration of niche and network theories to reach new frontiers of knowledge exploring how interactions within and across trophic levels promote species coexistence. This integration is possible due to the strong parallelisms in the historical development, ecological concepts, and associated mathematical tools of both theories. We provide a guideline to integrate this framework with observational and experimental studies.},

	abstract = {Species richness is a fundamental measurement of community and regional diversity, and it underlies many ecological models and conservation strategies. In spite of its importance, ecologists have not always appreciated the effects of abundance and sampling effort on richness measures and comparisons. We survey a series of common pitfalls in quantifying and comparing taxon richness. These pitfalls can be largely avoided by using accumulation and rarefaction curves, which may be based on either individuals or samples. These taxon sampling curves contain the basic information for valid richness comparisons, including category–subcategory ratios (species-to-genus and species-to-individual ratios). Rarefaction methods – both sample-based and individual-based – allow for meaningful standardization and comparison of datasets. Standardizing data sets by area or sampling effort may produce very different results compared to standardizing by number of individuals collected, and it is not always clear which measure of diversity is more appropriate. Asymptotic richness estimators provide lower-bound estimates for taxon-rich groups such as tropical arthropods, in which observed richness rarely reaches an asymptote, despite intensive sampling. Recent examples of diversity studies of tropical trees, stream invertebrates, and herbaceous plants emphasize the importance of carefully quantifying species richness using taxon sampling curves.},

To compare curves from different sites, we agree that number of individuals may be an unbiased measure of effort.

We used Monte Carlo simulations to construct hypothetical series of habitat units, then examined how number of species, similarity in relative abundances, and number of microhabitats accumulated with increasing number of habitat units (i.e., sampling effort). Proportions of all species and microhabitats represented were relatively low and variable at low sampling effort, but increased asymptotically and became less variable with greater sampling effort. To facilitate comparisons among streams, we fitted simulation results to negative exponential curves. The curves indicated that 90\% of the species present were usually found by sampling 5 to 24 habitat units (stream length of 22-67 stream widths). Estimates of species relative abundances required less sampling effort for a given accuracy than estimates of number of species. Rates of species accumulation (with effort) varied among streams and reflected discontinuity in species distributions among habitat units. Most discontinuity seemed to be due to low population density rather than to habitat selectivity. Results from an Illinois stream corroborated our findings from Virginia, and suggested that greater sampling effort is needed to characterize fish community structure in more homogeneous stream reaches.},

The exposure gradient incorporates disturbance, through the removal of plant biomass, and stress. through the creation of a gradient in sediment organic content, nutrient concentrations, and fine particle sizes. Species distributions on the exposure gradient were quantified by determining the mean sediment organic content ofthe quadrats containing each species. Competitive abilities were measured as relative increase in dry mass per plant, in a field experiment in which species were grown together in all pairwise combinations (N = 10 replicates). Species had significantly heterogeneous competitive abilities (P {\textless} .01). Species found on exposed, nutrient-poor shores (e.g., E. septangulare) had low competitive abilities, while those growing on sheltered, nutrient-rich shores (e.g., D. arundinaceum) had high competitive abilities. Competitive ability was significantly correlated with mean position on the ex? posure gradient.},

	abstract = {A resource-based model of competition correctly predicted the equilibrium outcome and approximated the population and nutrient dynamics of many nutrient-limited competition experiments with two algal species at temperatures from 8° to 24°C. Silicate growth kinetics of temperature-acclimated Asterionella formosa and Synedra ulna predicted that Asterionella should competitively displace Synedra below 20°C and Synedra should displace Asterionella above 20°C, as was observed. Although the growth kinetics showed no significant difference in silicate requirements at 20°C, Synedra displaced Asterionella for all starting conditions at 20°C. These experiments support a major prediction of an equilibrium theory of competition for a single resource: independent of initial population densities, the species with the lowest resource requirement should displace all competitors. Thus resource requirements, as defined by a mechanistic model, may be appropriate for defining niche boundaries. In single species experiments, fit to the Monod model with a nutrient threshold, the nutrient-saturated growth rate of Synedra increased from 0.16·d−1 at 8°C to 0.75 at 13°C and above; its half-saturation constant for growth was ca. 5.0 µM SiO2, independent of temperature from 8° to 24°C. The nutrient-saturated growth rate of Asterionella increased from 0.35·d−1 at 4°C to 0.8 at 13°C, and decreased to 0.66 at 24°C; its half-saturation constant for growth had a temperature-independent value of 2.1 µM SiO2 from 4° to 13°C, but increased to 10 µM SiO2 at 24°C. Half-saturation constants for silicate-limited growth may be temperature-independent for temperatures within or below the optimal temperature range, but increase sharply for temperatures above it.},

	abstract = {Most bioassessment programs rest on the assumption that species have different niches, and that abiotic environmental conditions and changes therein determine community structure. This assumption is thus equivalent to the species sorting perspective (i.e. that species differ in their responses to environmental variation) in metacommunity ecology. The degree to which basing bioassessment on the species sorting perspective is reasonable is likely to be related to the spatial extent of a study and the characteristics of the organism groups (e.g. dispersal ability) with which the effects of anthropogenic changes are assessed. Recent ﬁndings in metacommunity research have stressed that community structure is determined not only by local abiotic environmental conditions but also by biotic interactions and dispersal-related effects. For example, dispersal limitation may prevent community structure recovery from the effects of a putative stressor, as organisms may not be able to disperse to all sites in a region. Mass effects (i.e. the presence of species in environmentally suboptimal sites due to high dispersal rates from environmentally suitable sites) may, in turn, obscure the effects of a stressor, as dispersal from source sites (e.g. an unaltered site) allows persistence at sink sites (e.g. an anthropogenically altered site). Better bioassessment should thus take both niche- and dispersal-related processes simultaneously into consideration, which can be accomplished by explicitly modelling spatial location as a proxy for dispersal effects. Such an integrated approach should be included in bioassessment programs using general multivariate approaches, predictive modelling, and multimetric indices.},

	abstract = {Ecological communities show extremely complex patterns of variation in space, and quantifying the relative importance of spatial and environmental factors underpinning patterns of species distributions is one of the main goals of community ecology. Although we have accumulated good knowledge about the processes driving species distributions within metacommunities, we have few insights about whether (and how) environmental and spatial features can actually generate consistent species distributional patterns across multiple metacommunities. In this paper we applied the elements of metacommunity structure (EMS) framework to identify and classify metacommunities according to multiple but discrete patterns of species distributions. Given that each pattern has unique underlying structuring mechanisms, exploring and comparing such patterns across multiple metacommunities spanning large geographical areas provides a way to test the existence of general principles underlying species distributions within metacommunities. In this study, we applied the EMS framework into a data set containing about 9000 lakes distributed across 85 ﬁsh metacommunities across Ontario, Canada, and estimated the relative importance of local and spatial factors in explaining their distributional patterns. Nested and Clementsian gradients were the patterns that ﬁtted most metacommunities; nested metacommunities were distributed throughout the province, while Clementsian gradient metacommunities were concentrated in the southeastern region. Sixty-ﬁve percent of nested metacommunities were located in low-energy watersheds (i.e., colder climate and shorter growing season), whereas metacommunities representing Clementsian gradients were present in high-energy watersheds (i.e., relatively warmer climate and longer growing season). Taken together, our results reveal that the environmental and spatial properties in which metacommunities are embedded are at least partially responsible for their species distributional patterns.},

We tested model predictions with a field experiment on the clonal grass Elymus nutans in an alpine meadow. In the model, the relationship between mean individual biomass and density shifted from monotonic to humped as abiotic stress increased. The model results were supported by the field experiment, in which the greatest individual and population biomass were found at intermediate densities in a high-stress alpine habitat.

	abstract = {Large-scale patterns in species diversity and community composition are associated with environmental gradients, but the implications of these patterns for food-web structure are still unclear. Here, we investigated how spatial patterns in food-web structure are associated with environmental gradients in the Barents Sea, a highly productive shelf sea of the Arctic Ocean. We compared food webs from 25 subregions in the Barents Sea and examined spatial correlations among food-web metrics, and between metrics and spatial variability in seawater temperature, bottom depth and number of days with ice cover. Several food-web metrics were positively associated with seawater temperature: connectance, level of omnivory, clustering, cannibalism, and high variability in generalism, while other food-web metrics such as modularity and vulnerability were positively associated with sea ice and negatively with temperature. Food-web metrics positively associated with habitat heterogeneity were: number of species, link density, omnivory, path length, and trophic level. This finding suggests that habitat heterogeneity promotes food-web complexity in terms of number of species and link density. Our analyses reveal that spatial variation in food-web structure along the environmental gradients is partly related to species turnover. However, the higher interaction turnover compared to species turnover along these gradients indicates a consistent modification of food-web structure, implying that interacting species may co-vary in space. In conclusion, our study shows how environmental heterogeneity, via environmental filtering, influences not only turnover in species composition, but also the structure of food webs over large spatial scales.},

To really understand the full dynamic behaviour, a more rigorous mathematical analysis is required. We show that just a basic stability analysis is insufficient to describe the relevant dynamics of this deceptively simple model. To investigate realistic invasion and succession processes, not only the stable state is relevant, but also the time scales at which the system moves away from the unstable situation. We argue that the relative stability of saddle points is more important for the actual observed transient dynamics in realistic systems than the predicted asymptotic behaviour towards the stable equilibria. For the mathematical analysis this implies that not only the signs, but also the magnitudes of the eigenvalues of the Jacobi matrix at the stationary points, the rates at which the system evolves, must be considered. We present the underlying mathematics of the Tilman model in a way that should be accessible to any ecologist with a basic mathematical background.},

	abstract = {Naturally stressed ecosystems hold a unique fraction of biodiversity. However, they have been largely ignored in biomonitoring and conservation programmes, such as the EU Water Framework Directive, while global change pressures are threatening their singular values. Here we present a framework to classify and evaluate the ecological quality of naturally stressed rivers along a water salinity gradient. We gathered datasets, including aquatic macroinvertebrate assemblages and environmental information, for 243 river locations across the western Mediterranean to: a) gauge the role of natural stressors (salinity) in driving aquatic community richness and composition; b) make river classifications by encompassing the wide range of environmental and biological variation exhibited by Mediterranean rivers; c) provide effective biomonitoring metrics of ecological quality for saline rivers. Our results showed that water salinity played a pivotal role in explaining the community richness and compositional changes in rivers, even when considering other key and commonly used descriptors, such as elevation, climate or lithology. Both environmental and biologically-based classifications included seven river types: three types of freshwater perennial rivers, one freshwater intermittent river type and three new saline river types. These new saline types were not included in previous classifications. Their validation by independent datasets showed that the saline and freshwater river types represented differentiable macroinvertebrate assemblages at family and species levels. Biomonitoring metrics based on the abundance of indicator taxa of each saline river type provided a much better assessment of the ecological quality of saline rivers than other widely used biological metrics and indices. Here we demonstrate that considering natural stressors, such as water salinity, is essential to design effective and accurate biomonitoring programmes for rivers and to preserve their unique biodiversity.},

	abstract = {Biodiversity encompasses multiple attributes such as the richness and abundance of species (taxonomic diversity), the presence of different evolutionary lineages (phylogenetic diversity), and the variety of growth forms and resource use strategies (functional diversity). These biodiversity attributes do not necessarily relate to each other and may have contrasting effects on ecosystem functioning. However, how they simultaneously influence the provision of multiple ecosystem functions related to carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus cycling (multifunctionality) remains unknown. We evaluated the effects of the taxonomic, phylogenetic, and functional attributes of dominant (mass ratio effects) and subordinate (richness effect) plant species on the multifunctionality of 123 drylands from six continents. Our results highlight the importance of the phylogenetic and functional attributes of subordinate species as key drivers of multifunctionality. In addition to a higher taxonomic richness, we found that simultaneously increasing the richness of early diverging lineages and the functional redundancy between species increased multifunctionality. In contrast, the richness of most recent evolutionary lineages and the functional and phylogenetic attributes of dominant plant species (mass ratio effects) were weakly correlated with multifunctionality. However, they were important drivers of individual nutrient cycles. By identifying which biodiversity attributes contribute the most to multifunctionality, our results can guide restoration efforts aiming to maximize either multifunctionality or particular nutrient cycles, a critical step to combat dryland desertification worldwide.},

	abstract = {The competitive exclusion principle is fundamental to understanding coexistence. Well-established theories predict the conditions for coexistence in consumer–resource interactions. Given that species often compete for commodities offered by mutualists, competitive exclusion theory should also be critical to understanding how mutualisms function. We explicitly apply the competitive exclusion principle to mutualism and derive a rule analogous to Tilman's R* rule for exploitative competition. Coexistence is impossible when competitors compete solely for a shared partner-provided commodity because superior competitors deplete that commodity sufficiently to exclude inferior competitors. We then investigate how competition between two guild members for a partner-provided commodity and a resource external to the mutualism affects competitor coexistence. There are three key results. First, coexistence is possible via partitioning of a partner-provided commodity and another resource. Second, unlike in classic R* Theory, competitive outcomes are influenced both by species’ abilities to obtain commodities and their mutualisms with the shared commodity-providing partner, which can indirectly alleviate competitors’ commodity limitation. Third, the outcome of competition has important consequences for the commodity-providing partner, which depend on the type of mutualism and the competitive abilities of competing mutualists. This theory provides a novel framework for investigating how competitors for mutualistic commodities coexist in nature.},

	abstract = {Aim How do factors such as space, time, climate and other ecological drivers influence food web structure and dynamics? Collections of well-studied food webs and replicate food webs from the same system that span biogeographical and ecological gradients now enable detailed, quantitative investigation of such questions and help integrate food web ecology and macroecology. Here, we integrate macroecology and food web ecology by focusing on how ecogeographical rules [the latitudinal diversity gradient (LDG), Bergmann's rule, the island rule and Rapoport's rule] are associated with the architecture of food webs. Location Global. Time period Current. Major taxa studied All taxa. Methods We discuss the implications of each ecogeographical rule for food webs, present predictions for how food web structure will vary with each rule, assess empirical support where available, and discuss how food webs may influence ecogeographical rules. Finally, we recommend systems and approaches for further advancing this research agenda. Results We derived testable predictions for some ecogeographical rules (e.g. LDG, Rapoport's rule), while for others (e.g., Bergmann's and island rules) it is less clear how we would expect food webs to change over macroecological scales. Based on the LDG, we found weak support for both positive and negative relationships between food chain length and latitude and for increased generality and linkage density at higher latitudes. Based on Rapoport's rule, we found support for the prediction that species turnover in food webs is inversely related to latitude. Main conclusions The macroecology of food webs goes beyond traditional approaches to biodiversity at macroecological scales by focusing on trophic interactions among species. The collection of food web data for different types of ecosystems across biogeographical gradients is key to advance this research agenda. Further, considering food web interactions as a selection pressure that drives or disrupts ecogeographical rules has the potential to address both mechanisms of and deviations from these macroecological relationships. For these reasons, further integration of macroecology and food webs will help ecologists better understand the assembly, maintenance and change of ecosystems across space and time.},

Despite diatom-based indices are known to respond fastly to water quality degradation, they are not designed to precisely identify the nature of pressures co-occurring in the environment. Based on large scale monitoring data, we aimed at building models able to estimate the risk of stream impairment by many types of anthropogenic pressures from taxonomybased and trait-based characteristics of diatom assemblages. Random forest models were built to individually evaluate the impairment risk of diatom assemblages for six chemical and ﬁve hydromorphological or land-use related pressure categories. Eight models provided good impairment risk assessment (Area Under the Curve ≥ 0.70). Under multi-pressure scenarios, models built for chemical pressures exhibited a better accuracy than hydromorphological or land-use related ones. Models were able to detect both ecological restoration and degradation, based on long-term surveys. These models have been implemented in a R user-friendly routine, to help stream managers to early identify degrading processes and prioritize management actions.},

This is due primarily to a failure to distinguish between the cause and the effect of the perturbation in question. The cause and effect may be either short- or long-term and clearly one may be short-term and the other long-term. Distinction between these two types of disturbance is crucial for management to prevent further impact. Thus, it is important to describe separately these two aspects of a perturbation. Here, we define a protocol for sampling perturbations which enables the cause and effect to be distinguished between short- or long-term. Existing (i.e., already established) assemblages and newly-established assemblages are sampled and compared among disturbed and control locations. Existing assemblages may have been affected by past (pulse) disturbances and/or ongoing (press) disturbances, whereas the establishment of new assemblages can only be influenced by ongoing disturbances. We describe the procedures for assessing impacts of estuarine marinas as an illustration of the issues to be considered in any habitat. Settlement plates and defaunated sediment are suggested for sampling the establishment of new assemblages in aquatic environments.},

	abstract = {Abstract The biodiversity of food webs is composed of horizontal (i.e. within trophic levels) and vertical diversity (i.e. the number of trophic levels). Understanding their joint effect on stability is a key challenge. Theory mostly considers their individual effects and focuses on small perturbations near equilibrium in hypothetical food webs. Here, we study the joint effects of horizontal and vertical diversity on the stability of hypothetical (modelled) and empirical food webs. In modelled food webs, horizontal and vertical diversity increased and decreased stability, respectively, with a stronger positive effect of producer diversity on stability at higher consumer diversity. Experiments with an empirical plankton food web, where we manipulated horizontal and vertical diversity and measured stability from species interactions and from resilience against large perturbations, confirmed these predictions. Taken together, our findings highlight the need to conserve horizontal biodiversity at different trophic levels to ensure stability.},

We apply the four postulates to an important class of pulse events, biomass-altering disturbances, and derive seven generalizations that predict disturbance magnitude, resource trajectory, rate of resource change, disturbance probability, biotic trait diversification at evolutionary scales, biotic diversity at ecological scales, and functional resilience. Ultimately, theory must define the variable combinations that result in dynamic stability, comprising resistance, recovery, and adaptation.},

	abstract = {The difficulty of experimentally quantifying non-trophic species interactions has long troubled ecologists. Increasingly, a new application of the classic “checkerboard distribution” approach is used to infer interactions by examining the pairwise frequency at which species are found to spatially co-occur. However, the link between spatial associations, as estimated from observational co-occurrence, and species interactions has not been tested. Here we used nine common statistical methods to estimate associations from surveys of rocky intertidal communities in the Northeast Pacific Ocean. We compared those inferred associations with a new data set of experimentally determined net and direct species interactions. Although association methods generated networks with aggregate structure similar to previously published interaction networks, each method detected a different set of species associations from the same data set. Moreover, although association methods generally performed better than a random model, associations rarely matched empirical net or direct species interactions, with high rates of false positives and true positives, and many false negatives. Our findings cast doubt on studies that equate species co-occurrences to species interactions and highlight a persistent, unanswered question: how do we interpret spatial patterns in communities? We suggest future research directions to unify the observational and experimental study of species interactions, and discuss the need for community standards and best practices in association analysis.},

	abstract = {Co-occurrence methods are increasingly utilized in ecology to infer networks of species interactions where detailed knowledge based on empirical studies is difficult to obtain. Their use is particularly common, but not restricted to, microbial networks constructed from metagenomic analyses. In this study, we test the efficacy of this procedure by comparing an inferred network constructed using spatially intensive co-occurrence data from the rocky intertidal zone in central Chile to a well-resolved, empirically based, species interaction network from the same region. We evaluated the overlap in the information provided by each network and the extent to which there is a bias for co-occurrence data to better detect known trophic or non-trophic, positive or negative interactions. We found a poor correspondence between the co-occurrence network and the known species interactions with overall sensitivity (probability of true link detection) equal to 0.469, and specificity (true non-interaction) equal to 0.527. The ability to detect interactions varied with interaction type. Positive non-trophic interactions such as commensalism and facilitation were detected at the highest rates. These results demonstrate that co-occurrence networks do not represent classical ecological networks in which interactions are defined by direct observations or experimental manipulations. Co-occurrence networks provide information about the joint spatial effects of environmental conditions, recruitment, and, to some extent, biotic interactions, and among the latter, they tend to better detect niche-expanding positive non-trophic interactions. Detection of links (sensitivity or specificity) was not higher for well-known intertidal keystone species than for the rest of consumers in the community. Thus, as observed in previous empirical and theoretical studies, patterns of interactions in co-occurrence networks must be interpreted with caution, especially when extending interaction-based ecological theory to interpret network variability and stability. Co-occurrence networks may be particularly valuable for analysis of community dynamics that blends interactions and environment, rather than pairwise interactions alone.},

Empirical measurements of nutrient uptake in large rivers are lacking, despite a substantial body of knowledge on nutrient transport and removal in smaller streams. Researchers interested in nutrient transport by rivers (discharge .10 000 L/s) are left to extrapolate riverine nutrient demand using a modeling framework or a mass balance approach. To begin to ﬁll this knowledge gap, we present data using a pulse method to measure inorganic nitrogen (N) transport and removal in the Upper Snake River, Wyoming, USA (seventh order, discharge 12 000 L/s). We found that the Upper Snake had surprisingly high biotic demand relative to smaller streams in the same river network for both ammonium (NH4þ) and nitrate (NO3À). Placed in the context of a meta-analysis of previously published nutrient uptake studies, these data suggest that large rivers may have similar biotic demand for N as smaller tributaries. We also found that demand for different forms of inorganic N (NH4þ vs. NO3À) scaled differently with stream size. Data from rivers like the Upper Snake and larger are essential for effective water quality management at the scale of river networks. Empirical measurements of solute dynamics in large rivers are needed to understand the role of whole river networks (as opposed to stream reaches) in patterns of nutrient export at regional and continental scales.},

Yet, ninety years into this theory, the conditions under which these patterns may occur and persist in nature remain subject to debate. Rather than address each pattern in isolation, we propose that they must be understood together, calling for synthesis in a fragmented landscape of theoretical and empirical results. As a ﬁrst step, we propose a minimal theory that combines the long-standing energetic and dynamical approaches of food chains. We chart theoretical predictions on a concise map, where two main regimes emerge: across various functioning and stability metrics, one regime is characterised by pyramidal patterns and the other by cascade patterns. The axes of this map combine key physiological and ecological variables, such as metabolic rates and self-regulation. A quantitative comparison with data sheds light on conﬂicting theoretical predictions and empirical puzzles, from size spectra to causes of trophic cascade strength. We conclude that drawing systematic connections between various existing approaches to food chains, and between their predictions on functioning and stability, is a crucial step in confronting this theory to real ecosystems.},

We demonstrate that this mechanistic concept successfully explains the positive, negative and neutral net effects of predators on decomposers in a litter microcosm experiment. This approach offers a new perspective on the interplay of complex interactions within food webs and is easily extendable to include phylogenetic and other body-mass independent traits.

We systematically varied predator body size, guild composition and richness in microcosm insect webs and compared experimental outcomes with predictions of IS from models with allometrically scaled parameters. Body size was a strong predictor of IS in simple modules (r2 = 0.92), but with increasing complexity the predictive power decreased, with model IS being consistently overestimated. We quantify the strength of observed trophic interaction modiﬁcations, partition this into density-mediated vs. behaviour-mediated indirect effects and show that model shortcomings in predicting IS is related to the size of behaviourmediated effects.

However, diversity–stability relationships (DSRs) are analysed using a variety of different population and community properties, most of which are adopted from theory that makes several restrictive assumptions that are unlikely to be reflected in nature. Here, we construct a simple synthesis and generalisation of previous theory for the DSR. We show that community stability is a product of two quantities: the synchrony of population fluctuations, and an average species-level population stability that is weighted by relative abundance. Weighted average population stability can be decomposed to consider effects of the mean-variance scaling of abundance, changes in mean abundance with diversity and differences in species' mean abundance in monoculture. Our framework makes explicit how unevenness in the abundances of species in real communities influences the DSR, which occurs both through effects on community synchrony, and effects on weighted average population variability. This theory provides a more robust framework for analysing the results of empirical studies of the DSR, and facilitates the integration of findings from real and model communities.},

	abstract = {Human land use may detrimentally affect biodiversity, yet long-term stability of species communities is vital for maintaining ecosystem functioning. Community stability can be achieved by higher species diversity (portfolio effect), higher asynchrony across species (insurance hypothesis) and higher abundance of populations. However, the relative importance of these stabilizing pathways and whether they interact with land use in real-world ecosystems is unknown. We monitored inter-annual fluctuations of 2,671 plant, arthropod, bird and bat species in 300 sites from three regions. Arthropods show 2.0-fold and birds 3.7-fold higher community fluctuations in grasslands than in forests, suggesting a negative impact of forest conversion. Land-use intensity in forests has a negative net impact on stability of bats and in grasslands on birds. Our findings demonstrate that asynchrony across species—much more than species diversity alone—is the main driver of variation in stability across sites and requires more attention in sustainable management.},

However, it remains unknown whether these findings are relevant to natural ecosystems, especially those for which species diversity is threatened by anthropogenic global change8,9,10,11. Here we analyse diversity–stability relationships from 41 grasslands on five continents and examine how these relationships are affected by chronic fertilization, one of the strongest drivers of species loss globally8. Unmanipulated communities with more species had greater species asynchrony, resulting in more stable biomass production, generalizing a result from biodiversity experiments to real-world grasslands. However, fertilization weakened the positive effect of diversity on stability. Contrary to expectations, this was not due to species loss after eutrophication but rather to an increase in the temporal variation of productivity in combination with a decrease in species asynchrony in diverse communities. Our results demonstrate separate and synergistic effects of diversity and eutrophication on stability, emphasizing the need to understand how drivers of global change interactively affect the reliable provisioning of ecosystem services in real-world systems.},

Such behavioural responses on the landscape drive a highly adaptive food-web structure in space and time. Empirical evidence suggests that underlying attributes of food webs are potentially scale-invariant such that food webs are characterized by hump-shaped trophic structures with fast and slow pathways that repeat at different resolutions within the food web. We place these empirical patterns within the context of recent food-web theory to show that adaptable food-web structure confers stability to an assemblage of interacting organisms in a variable world. Finally, we show that recent food-web analyses agree with two of the major predictions of this theory. We argue that the next major frontier in food-web theory and applied food-web ecology must consider the influence of variability on food-web structure.},

	abstract = {Abstract Many empirical studies motivated by an interest in stable coexistence have quantified negative density dependence, negative frequency dependence, or negative plant?soil feedback, but the links between these empirical results and ecological theory are not straightforward. Here, we relate these analyses to theoretical conditions for stabilisation and stable coexistence in classical competition models. By stabilisation, we mean an excess of intraspecific competition relative to interspecific competition that inherently slows or even prevents competitive exclusion. We show that most, though not all, tests demonstrating negative density dependence, negative frequency dependence, and negative plant?soil feedback constitute sufficient conditions for stabilisation of two-species interactions if applied to data for per capita population growth rates of pairs of species, but none are necessary or sufficient conditions for stable coexistence of two species. Potential inferences are even more limited when communities involve more than two species, and when performance is measured at a single life stage or vital rate. We then discuss two approaches that enable stronger tests for stable coexistence-invasibility experiments and model parameterisation. The model parameterisation approach can be applied to typical density-dependence, frequency-dependence, and plant?soil feedback data sets, and generally enables better links with mechanisms and greater insights, as demonstrated by recent studies.},

	abstract = {Nurse plants drive the assembly of facilitated communities and commonly promote plant–soil feedbacks, and are thus recognized as key engineers in abiotically stressful ecosystems. The literature neglects; however, the role of the communities which benefit from the presence of the nurse as contributors to soil ecosystem functions. We hypothesized that the nurse and its beneficiaries synergistically enhance essential ecosystem functions mediated by soil microbiota. To track how plant–plant facilitation impacts plant–soil feedbacks, we selected three nurse species in semi-arid mine tailings and defined three microsites (open space, nurse canopy and nurse + facilitated canopy). In each microsite, we quantified 18 abiotic and biotic variables associated with four functions: reduction in climatic stress, reduction in edaphic stress, soil fertility and soil microbial productivity (decomposition and nutrient cycling). Litter biomass increased from open spaces to the microsite beneath the nurses, and further beneath the nurses and their beneficiaries. Litter biomass was a good predictor of both the reduction in climatic stress and increase in edaphic stress (likely owing to metal bioaccumulation). We attributed increments in soil organics and heterotrophic respiration beneath the nurses and their beneficiaries, compared to nurses alone, to biomass effects through increased litter deposition. Variation in fertility and microbial productivity among microsites shaped by the nurses and their facilitated communities was attributed to both diversity and biomass effects. In particular, fertility was promoted beneath phenotypically diverse facilitated communities, as inferred from ten above- and below-ground traits. However, microbial productivity increased at low levels of root biomass likely due to reduced plant–microbe competition for nutrients. Synthesis. Our results show that facilitated plant communities sheltered by nurse species relieve local abiotic stress and promote plant–microbe interactions, both through biomass and biodiversity effects. These observations shift the conception of facilitated species from simple beneficiaries of the nurse's effects to co-drivers of essential ecosystem functions.},

	abstract = {Several plant species have the potential to facilitate the presence of other plant species in the community, and yet most of our knowledge on this phenomenon comes from studies considering only one facilitator species. What happens when there are two facilitator species in the community? Are the facilitation effects by one species being altered by the presence of a potentially second facilitator species and vice-versa (i.e. bidirectional facilitation)? Knowing that cushion plants ameliorate stress and improve soil fertility and that cluster root-bearing species mobilize soil phosphorus (P), we investigated the potential occurrence of bidirectional facilitation via stress amelioration and nutrient exchange in the cushion plant Acaena integerrima (Rosaceae) and the cluster root-bearing tree species Embothrium coccineum (Proteaceae). In southern Chile, where both species naturally occur, we compared aspects of the vegetative and reproductive performance of each species growing in association or not. We also determined if Embothrium alters the nurse effects of Acaena cushions on other species by evaluating species richness, frequency, and abundance in cushion plants with and without Embothrium. To infer the existence of nutrient exchange, we determined soil and leaf nutrient levels of both species. Species richness, frequency and abundance were higher within than outside Acaena cushions. Although the presence of Embothrium did not enhance the overall positive effects of Acaena on species composition, nine species occurred more frequently when Embothrium was present. Embothrium occurred more frequently and had a higher survival and leaf nitrogen (N) concentration when growing with Acaena than without it, although its growth and leaf P concentration were lower. In contrast, Acaena had a lower number of and mass of fruits per inflorescence and a higher leaf P concentration when growing with versus growing without Embothrium. Synthesis. The cushion plant Acaena integerrima facilitates the occurrence of many species in the community, including the cluster root-bearing species Embothrium coccineum, which in turn enhances the facilitation effect of Acaena on certain species. When Embothrium and Acaena occur together, the latter improves its nutritional status but reduces its fitness, implying a lack of bidirectional facilitation.},

	abstract = {Niche availability, niche overlap and competitive ability are key determinants of the distribution and abundance of species. However, quantifying each of these components is difficult because it is not always possible to identify or measure relevant environmental gradients (niche axes) along which species might partition or compete for niche space. We describe a method that uses seed addition experiments to quantify the number of ‘safe-sites’ (microsites suitable for a species to recruit from seed) at a location and show how this method can be used to quantify niche availability, niche overlap and competitive ability. We illustrate our approach using two seed addition experiments in grassland. In the first experiment, we added seeds of one native and two exotic grass species, alone and in mixture, to plots that were arrayed along a gradient of soil moisture availability. We show that the three species partitioned safe-sites, implying that all three species could locally co-occur through niche partitioning, in part due to different responses to moisture availability. In the second experiment, we added seeds of three commonly co-occurring native grass species, alone and in mixture, to plots with no obvious environmental gradients. One species out-competed two others for site occupancy, allowing us to quantify both the degree of niche overlap and the relative ability of each species to compete for safe-site occupancy without a priori knowledge of the niche axes. Results from both experiments demonstrate the fine-scales at which species can partition niches to facilitate co-occurrence. Synthesis. By conceptualising a plot of ground as containing a limited number of microsites that are safe for the recruitment of a given species, and using seed addition experiments to measure both the number of safe-sites and degree of safe-site overlap among species, we show how niche availability, niche overlap and competitive ability can be quantified at fine-scales without a priori knowledge of niche axes. Our approach allows questions about niche availability and competition for shared niche space to be empirically tested, and to examine how these processes vary along environmental gradients to shape species distributions and patterns of co-occurrence.},

However, cross-scale investigation of their combined effects by linking theory and experiments is lacking. We collected data from aquatic microbial ecosystems investigating the interactive effects of warming (constant and rising temperatures) and enrichment across levels of organisation and contrasted them with community models based on metabolic theory. We found high agreement between our observations and theoretical predictions: we observed in many cases the predicted antagonistic effects of high temperature and high enrichment across levels of organisation. Temporal stability of total biomass decreased with warming but did not differ across enrichment levels. Constant and rising temperature treatments with identical mean temperature did not show qualitative differences. Overall, we conclude that model and empirical results are in broad agreement due to robustness of the effects of temperature and enrichment, that the mitigating effects of temperature on effects of enrichment may be common, and that models based on metabolic theory provide qualitatively robust predictions of the combined ecological effects of enrichment and temperature.},

	abstract = {Recently accumulated evidence has documented a climate impact on the demography and dynamics of single species, yet the impact at the community level is poorly understood. Here, we show that in Svalbard in the high Arctic, extreme weather events synchronize population fluctuations across an entire community of resident vertebrate herbivores and cause lagged correlations with the secondary consumer, the arctic fox. This synchronization is mainly driven by heavy rain on snow that encapsulates the vegetation in ice and blocks winter forage availability for herbivores. Thus, indirect and bottom-up climate forcing drives the population dynamics across all overwintering vertebrates. Icing is predicted to become more frequent in the circumpolar Arctic and may therefore strongly affect terrestrial ecosystem characteristics.

We analyzed time series of the abundance of ten species of spring foliage feeding Lepidoptera sampled over a 25-year period at 20 sites in the Slovak Republic. Six species were free-feeders and four were leaf-rollers as larvae. Twenty-nine percent of interspecific pairs were significantly synchronous and correlations were highest among species exhibiting similar feeding strategies. Similar patterns of interspecific synchrony have been previously demonstrated in several other taxa, and the synchronizing effects of weather and/or specialist predators have been proposed as mechanisms. As an alternative explanation, we explored a model in which two species within the same feeding guild were synchronized by the functional response of generalist predators. In this model, species remained unsynchronized in the complete absence of predation or when predatory pressures were applied to only one species. Pairs of prey species projecting relatively similar search images to predators were more highly synchronized than species with relatively different search images. Prey handling time only influenced synchrony when it was very high relative to the total time prey was exposed to predators. Our model's prediction of greater synchrony among species that project similar search images to predators was in agreement with our field study that showed greater synchrony among species sharing similar larval feeding strategies and morphologies.},

In other words, we know that plant traits can vary widely for a given genotype, but we know little about the importance of trait-mediated interactions (TMI) among plants. Here, we discuss three major factors that affect the expression of phenotypic plasticity: variation in the abiotic environment, variation in the presence or identity of neighbors, and variation in herbivory. We consider how plastic responses to these factors might affect interactions among plants. Plastic responses to the abiotic environment have important consequences for conditionality in competitive effects, to the point of causing shifts from competitive to facilitative interactions. Because plants show a high degree of plasticity in response to neighbors, and even to the specific identify of neighbors, phenotypic plasticity may allow species to adjust to the composition of their communities, promoting coexistence and community diversity. Likewise, plastic responses to consumers may have various and counterintuitive consequences: induction of plant resistance, compensatory growth, and increased resource uptake may affect interactions among plants in ways that cannot be predicted simply by considering biomass lost to consumers. What little we know about TMI among plants suggests that they should not be ignored in plant community theory. Although work to date on the community consequences of phenotypic plasticity has been hampered by experimental constraints, new approaches such as manipulating phenotypes by using signals instead of actual environmental conditions and the use of transgenic plants should allow us to rapidly expand our understanding of the community consequences of plant plasticity.

	abstract = {Understanding how communities of living organisms assemble has been a central question in ecology since the early days of the discipline. Disentangling the different processes involved in community assembly is not only interesting in itself but also crucial for an understanding of how communities will behave under future environmental scenarios. The traditional concept of assembly rules reflects the notion that species do not co-occur randomly but are restricted in their co-occurrence by interspecific competition. This concept can be redefined in a more general framework where the co-occurrence of species is a product of chance, historical patterns of speciation and migration, dispersal, abiotic environmental factors, and biotic interactions, with none of these processes being mutually exclusive. Here we present a survey and meta-analyses of 59 papers that compare observed patterns in plant communities with null models simulating random patterns of species assembly. According to the type of data under study and the different methods that are applied to detect community assembly, we distinguish four main types of approach in the published literature: species co-occurrence, niche limitation, guild proportionality and limiting similarity. Results from our meta-analyses suggest that non-random co-occurrence of plant species is not a widespread phenomenon. However, whether this finding reflects the individualistic nature of plant communities or is caused by methodological shortcomings associated with the studies considered cannot be discerned from the available metadata. We advocate that more thorough surveys be conducted using a set of standardized methods to test for the existence of assembly rules in data sets spanning larger biological and geographical scales than have been considered until now. We underpin this general advice with guidelines that should be considered in future assembly rules research. This will enable us to draw more accurate and general conclusions about the non-random aspect of assembly in plant communities.},

However, existing food web models do not take into account likely changes in trophic interactions (‘rewiring’) following species loss. We investigated structural dynamics in 12 empirically documented food webs by simulating primary species loss using three realistic removal criteria, and measured robustness in terms of subsequent secondary extinctions. In our model, novel trophic interactions can be established between predators and food items not previously consumed following the loss of competing predator species. By considering the increase in robustness conferred through rewiring, we identify a new category of species – overlap species – which promote robustness as shown by comparing simulations incorporating structural dynamics to those with static topologies. The fraction of overlap species in a food web is highly correlated with this increase in robustness; whereas species richness and connectance are uncorrelated with increased robustness. Our findings underline the importance of compensatory mechanisms that may buffer ecosystems against environmental change, and highlight the likely role of particular species that are expected to facilitate this buffering.},

We studied pollination by bees in a mosaic of agricultural and natural habitats in California and dung burial by dung beetles on recently created islands in Venezuela. We found that large-bodied bee and beetle species tended to be both most extinction-prone and most functionally efficient, contributing to rapid functional loss. Simulations confirmed that extinction order led to greater disruption of function than predicted by random species loss. Total abundance declined with richness and also appeared to contribute to loss of function. We demonstrate conceptually and empirically how the non-random response of communities to disturbance can have unexpectedly large functional consequences.},

Nestedness is the degree to which a set of communities represent different-sized subsets from the same ordered composition of species. Strong nestedness has been associated with communities presumably ordered by extinction – landbridge islands, habitat fragments – but development of nestedness in such systems due to extinction over time has rarely been followed. We examined the effects of local extinction on the nested structure of experimentally isolated nematode and microarthropod communities. Experiments were conducted in Georgia, USA, intact soil and litter microcosms, and Derbyshire, UK, in situ moss microecosystems. Nestedness increased initially, as predicted, but there was evidence of a decline in nestedness later in both experiments. Increasing nestedness was consistent with predictable losses of species, such as loss of less common species, predators, or species of large body size. We hypothesize that the later phase of declining nestedness was due to increasing disorder in species’ chance of extinction as the experiments progressed, with the resulting stochastic differentiation of communities reducing nestedness.},

The two major perspectives, to date, are to assume that every species is functionally unique, or to assume that some species are functionally identical, such that functional groups exist. Using a continuous measure of functional diversity (FD) derived from the quantitative functional traits of species, we show that the loss of functional diversity from six natural assemblages was rapid compared with rates of loss from comparable simulated assemblages. Loss of FD occurred faster than loss of functional–group diversity in four of the six natural assemblages. Patterns of functional–group diversity loss depended on the number of functional groups and the number of species in an assemblage. Extinctions that occurred first for species with particular traits (e.g. low leaf nitrogen concentration, deep roots and large body size) caused greater loss of FD than expected by chance in four of the six natural assemblages. In two real assemblages, these trait–dependent extinctions had more severe effects on FD than our simulated worst–case extinction scenario. These data suggest that conserving a large proportion of the functional traits of species requires conserving a large proportion of all species.},

Neonicotinoids are a widely used group of pesticides that have been shown to have negative impacts on an increasing number of species, most notably pollinators. Eng et al. tested how exposure to these compounds influenced the behavior of a migrating songbird. Ingestion of field-realistic levels of neonicotinoid insecticides reduced feeding and accumulation of body mass and fat stores, which led to delayed departure from stopover sites. Such delays can lead to reduced migration survival and decreased reproductive success and therefore have the potential to impose population-level impacts.
Science, this issue p. 1177
Neonicotinoids are neurotoxic insecticides widely used as seed treatments, but little is known of their effects on migrating birds that forage in agricultural areas. We tracked the migratory movements of imidacloprid-exposed songbirds at a landscape scale using a combination of experimental dosing and automated radio telemetry. Ingestion of field-realistic quantities of imidacloprid (1.2 or 3.9 milligrams per kilogram body mass) by white-crowned sparrows (Zonotrichia leucophrys) during migratory stopover caused a rapid reduction in food consumption, mass, and fat and significantly affected their probability of departure. Birds in the high-dose treatment stayed a median of 3.5 days longer at the site of capture after exposure as compared with controls, likely to regain fuel stores or recover from intoxication. Migration delays can carry over to affect survival and reproduction; thus, these results confirm a link between sublethal pesticide exposure and adverse outcomes for migratory bird populations.
During migratory stopover of white-crowned sparrows, consumption of seeds treated with neonicotinoids reduced fattening and delayed departure.

This risk will be heightened if such wetlands are ecological traps – preferred habitats that confer lower fitness than another available habitat. Wetlands functioning as ecological traps could decrease both local and regional population persistence, and ultimately lead to extinctions. Most studies have examined how animals respond to changes in environmental conditions by measuring responses at the community and population levels, but studying ecological traps requires information on fitness and habitat preferences. Our current lack of knowledge of individual-level responses may therefore limit our capacity to manage wetland ecosystems effectively since ecological traps require different management practices to mitigate potential consequences. We conducted a global meta-analysis to characterise how animals respond to four key drivers of wetland alteration: agriculture, mining, restoration and urbanisation. Our overarching goal was to evaluate the ecological impacts of human alterations to wetland ecosystems, as well as identify current knowledge gaps that limit both the current understanding of these responses and effective wetland management. We extracted 1799 taxon-specific response ratios from 271 studies across 29 countries. Community- (e.g. richness) and population-level (e.g. density) measures within altered wetlands were largely comparable to those within reference wetlands. By contrast, individual fitness measures (e.g. survival) were often lower, highlighting the potential limitations of using only community- and population-level measures to assess habitat quality. Only four studies provided habitat-preference data, preventing investigation of the potential for altered wetlands to function as ecological traps. This is concerning because attempts to identify ecological traps may detect previously unidentified conservation risks. Although there was considerable variability amongst taxa, amphibians were typically the most sensitive taxon, and thus, may be a valuable bio-indicator of wetland quality. Despite suffering reduced survival and reproduction, measures such as time to and mass at metamorphosis were similar between altered and reference wetlands, suggesting that quantifying metamorphosis-related measures in isolation may not provide accurate information on habitat quality. Our review provides the most detailed evaluation to date of the ecological impacts of human alterations to wetland ecosystems. We emphasise that the role of wetlands in human-altered ecosystems can be complex, as they may represent important habitat but also pose potential risks to animals. Reduced availability of natural wetlands is increasing the importance of altered wetlands for aquatic animals. Consequently, we need to define what represents habitat quality from the perspective of animals, and gain a greater understanding of the underlying mechanisms of habitat selection and how these factors could be manipulated. Furthermore, strategies to enhance the quality of these wetlands should be implemented to maximise their conservation potential.},

	abstract = {Pesticides and herbicides gained popularity due to a strong need to curb the starvation of billions of humans. Glyphosate is the most commonly used herbicide and was considered to be non-toxic. But its use in excess in agricultural lands has polluted soils and waters. Nowadays, glyphosate residues are found in soil, water and food. As a result glyphosate causes severe acute and chronic toxicological effects. We review toxicological effects of glyphosate and metabolites on organisms of the kingdom animalia, both unicellular and multicellular organisms. Adverse effects on unicellular organisms have been established in many experiments. For instance, glyphosate has reduced the rate of photosynthesis in Euglena, has decreased the radial growth of mycorrhizal fungal species and is also reducing the profusion of certain bacteria present in rhizospheric microbial communities. Glyphosate poses serious threat to multicellular organisms as well. Its toxicological effects have been traced from lower invertebrates to higher vertebrates. Effects have been observed in annelids (earthworms), arthropods (crustaceans and insects), mollusks, echinoderms, fish, reptiles, amphibians and birds. Toxicological effects like genotoxicity, cytotoxicity, nuclear aberration, hormonal disruption, chromosomal aberrations and DNA damage have also been observed in higher vertebrates like humans.},

	abstract = {Global declines in insects have sparked wide interest among scientists, politicians, and the general public. Loss of insect diversity and abundance is expected to provoke cascading effects on food webs and to jeopardize ecosystem services. Our understanding of the extent and underlying causes of this decline is based on the abundance of single species or taxonomic groups only, rather than changes in insect biomass which is more relevant for ecological functioning. Here, we used a standardized protocol to measure total insect biomass using Malaise traps, deployed over 27 years in 63 nature protection areas in Germany (96 unique location-year combinations) to infer on the status and trend of local entomofauna. Our analysis estimates a seasonal decline of 76\%, and mid-summer decline of 82\% in flying insect biomass over the 27 years of study. We show that this decline is apparent regardless of habitat type, while changes in weather, land use, and habitat characteristics cannot explain this overall decline. This yet unrecognized loss of insect biomass must be taken into account in evaluating declines in abundance of species depending on insects as a food source, and ecosystem functioning in the European landscape.},

Predicting the wider ecological consequences of these declines requires understanding how predators influence communities by inflicting mortality on prey and inducing behavioral modifications (risk effects). Both mechanisms are important in marine communities, and a sole focus on the effects of predator-inflicted mortality might severely underestimate the importance of predators. We outline direct and indirect consequences of marine predator declines and propose an integrated predictive framework that includes risk effects, which appear to be strongest for long-lived prey species and when resources are abundant. We conclude that marine predators should be managed for the maintenance of both density- and risk-driven ecological processes, and not demographic persistence alone.},

	abstract = {Large predators potentially can help shape the structure and functioning of terrestrial ecosystems, yet strong evidence of top-down herbivore limitation has not been widely reported in the scientific literature. Herein we synthesize outcomes of recent tri-trophic cascades studies involving the presence and absence of large predators for five national parks in the western United States, including Olympic, Yosemite, Yellowstone, Zion, and Wind Cave. Historical observations by park biologists regarding woody browse species and recently compiled age structure data for deciduous trees indicate major impacts to woody plant communities by ungulates following the extirpation or displacement of large predators. Declines in long-term tree recruitment indexed additional effects to plant communities and ecological processes, as well as shifts towards alternative ecosystem states. The magnitude and consistency of vegetation impacts found within these five parks, in conjunction with other recent North American studies, indicate that broad changes to ecosystem processes and the lower trophic level may have occurred in other parts of the western United States where large predators have been extirpated or displaced. Thus, where ungulates have significantly altered native plant communities in the absence of large predators, restoration of native flora is urgently needed to recover former ecosystem services. Following the reintroduction of previously extirpated gray wolves Canis lupus into Yellowstone National Park, a spatially patchy recovery of woody browse species (e.g., aspen Populus tremuloides, willow Salix spp., cottonwood Populus spp.) has begun, indicating that large predator recovery may represent an important restoration strategy for ecosystems degraded by wild ungulates.},

	abstract = {The population extinction pulse we describe here shows, from a quantitative viewpoint, that Earth’s sixth mass extinction is more severe than perceived when looking exclusively at species extinctions. Therefore, humanity needs to address anthropogenic population extirpation and decimation immediately. That conclusion is based on analyses of the numbers and degrees of range contraction (indicative of population shrinkage and/or population extinctions according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature) using a sample of 27,600 vertebrate species, and on a more detailed analysis documenting the population extinctions between 1900 and 2015 in 177 mammal species. We find that the rate of population loss in terrestrial vertebrates is extremely high—even in “species of low concern.” In our sample, comprising nearly half of known vertebrate species, 32\% (8,851/27,600) are decreasing; that is, they have decreased in population size and range. In the 177 mammals for which we have detailed data, all have lost 30\% or more of their geographic ranges and more than 40\% of the species have experienced severe population declines ({\textgreater}80\% range shrinkage). Our data indicate that beyond global species extinctions Earth is experiencing a huge episode of population declines and extirpations, which will have negative cascading consequences on ecosystem functioning and services vital to sustaining civilization. We describe this as a “biological annihilation” to highlight the current magnitude of Earth’s ongoing sixth major extinction event.},

Nous avons retiré expérimentalement l’écrevisse américaine (Orconectes rusticus), une espèce envahissante, d’un lac du Wisconsin. L’abondance de l’espèce a diminué de 99 \% en huit ans, n’avait pas significativement augmenté quatre ans après la récolte, et aucune réponse de recrutement compensatoire n’a été observée. L’abondance des écrevisses indigènes (Orconectes virilis) et des crapets (Lepomis spp.) a augmenté de deux ordres de grandeur parallèlement à la diminution de l’abondance des écrevisses américaines, et la couverture de macrophytes a augmenté significativement dans les eaux de 2 m à 4 m de profondeur. Nous nous attendions à une augmentation de la densité de macroinvertébrés benthiques avec le retrait de l’écrevisse américaine, mais la consommation d’invertébrés par les poissons a augmenté parallèlement à la baisse de densité des écrevisses américaines, de sorte que la réponse des macroinvertébrés variait selon la famille et l’habitat. La densité totale des gastéropodes a été multipliée par 300 dans les galets, alors que la densité d’une famille de gastéropodes a diminué dans les macrophytes. Les densités des éphéméroptères, des odonates et des amphipodes ont également diminué dans certains habitats parallèlement au retrait de l’écrevisse américaine, ce qui suggère que leur présence est indirectement facilitée par cette dernière. Cette étude fait ressortir l’importance de tenir compte des effets indirects dans l’évaluation des impacts d’espèces envahissantes et démontre que ces impacts peuvent être renversés à relativement court terme.

We sampled such multiple networks simultaneously in an agroecosystem. We show that the networks varied in their robustness; networks including pollinators appeared to be particularly fragile. We show that, overall, networks did not strongly covary in their robustness, which suggests that ecological restoration (for example, through agri-environment schemes) benefitting one functional group will not inevitably benefit others. Some individual plant species were disproportionately well linked to many other species. This type of information can be used in restoration management, because it identifies the plant taxa that can potentially lead to disproportionate gains in biodiversity.
Analysis of seven interconnected networks on a farm reveals that they vary in their fragility, but that they do not covary.

While such systems could be widespread in nature, their properties are not well understood. Here, we study three robust critical ecosystem models and a null model that lacks spatial interactions. In all these models, individuals aggregate in patches whose size distributions follow power laws which melt down under increasing external stress. We propose that this power-law decay associated with the connectivity of the system can be used to evaluate the level of stress exerted on the ecosystem. We identify several indicators along the transition to extinction. These indicators give us a relative measure of the distance to extinction, and have therefore potential application to conservation biology, especially for ecosystems with self-organization and critical transitions.},

Why do symbionts provide costly services to a host, indirectly benefiting competitors sharing the same individual host? Host monitoring of symbiont performance and the imposition of sanctions on ‘cheats’ could stabilize mutualism5,6. Here we show that soybeans penalize rhizobia that fail to fix N2 inside their root nodules. We prevented a normally mutualistic rhizobium strain from cooperating (fixing N2) by replacing air with an N2-free atmosphere (Ar:O2). A series of experiments at three spatial scales (whole plants, half root systems and individual nodules) demonstrated that forcing non-cooperation (analogous to cheating) decreased the reproductive success of rhizobia by about 50\%. Non-invasive monitoring implicated decreased O2 supply as a possible mechanism for sanctions against cheating rhizobia. More generally, such sanctions by one or both partners may be important in stabilizing a wide range of mutualistic symbioses.},

	abstract = {Larvae of the midge Metriocnemus knabi and of the mosquito Wyeomyia smithii are found only inside the water—filled leaves of the carnivorous pitcher plant, Sarracenia purpurea, where they feed on decaying invertebrate carcasses. I examined the interaction between the two species in a natural population in western Newfoundland, Canada. Experimental manipulations of rates of prey capture by pitcher—plant leaves indicated that both insect species are limited by carcass supply. However, the interaction between them is commensal rather than competitive. Midge growth was unaffected by experimental quadrupling of mosquito density in otherwise unmanipulated leaves. Mosquito growth, on the other hand, increased with midge density in both natural leaves and artificial leaf microcosms. This interaction is an example of a processing chain commensalism. Although both species feed on carcass material, they use it in different stages of decay; midges feed by chewing on solid material, while mosquitoes filter—feed on particles derived from the decaying matter. Consumption of particles by mosquitoes does not affect resource availability for midges, but feeding by midges does influence particle availability. In artificial leaf microcosms, high bacterial densities occurred sooner in artificial leaves with midges present than in identical leaves without them. Bacteria are a direct food source for mosquitoes, and high bacterial densities also indicate that other organic material is being comminuted, providing particles for mosquitoes and surface area for bacterial growth. Although midges remove some of the carcass resource that also limits mosquitoes, their net effect on mosquitoes in positive because they accelerate conversion of the remaining resource to particles.},

Oxpeckers (Buphagus spp.) are unusual birds because they not only glean ticks from an array of African ungulates, but they are one of the few avian species known to wound-feed from their living hosts. The conditions under which oxpeckers wound-feed and the mechanisms generating variation in this association are unclear. We took a unique approach to studying the relationship by conducting a series of feeding preference experiments on twelve captive red-billed oxpeckers (B. erythrorhynchus). We assessed how oxpecker feeding behaviour is influenced by changes in tick abundance and tick type. In cafeteria-style experiments, oxpeckers fed equally on ticks and liquid bovine blood. In experiments using donkeys as the host animal, oxpeckers spent more time wound-feeding when a less-preferred tick type was available and when tick abundance was low compared to when a preferred tick type was available and when tick abundance was high. However, oxpeckers still wound-fed even when offered a large number of the ticks they prefer. Additional experiments incorporating tick species of different stages and multiple ungulate species are necessary to fully reveal the dynamics of this association.},

Impacts of the parasite on the abiotic environment 11 VIII. Concluding remarks 12 References 12 Summary Parasitic plants have profound effects on the ecosystems in which they occur. They are represented by some 4000 species and can be found in most major biomes. They acquire some or all of their water, carbon and nutrients via the vascular tissue of the host's roots or shoots. Parasitism has major impacts on host growth, allometry and reproduction, which lead to changes in competitive balances between host and nonhost species and therefore affect community structure, vegetation zonation and population dynamics. Impacts on hosts may further affect herbivores, pollinators and seed vectors, and the behaviour and diversity of these is often closely linked to the presence and abundance of parasitic plants. Parasitic plants can therefore be considered as keystone species. Community impacts are mediated by the host range of the parasite (the diversity of species that can potentially act as hosts) and by their preference and selection of particular host species. Parasitic plants can also alter the physical environment around them – including soil water and nutrients, atmospheric CO2 and temperature – and so may also be considered as ecosystem engineers. Such impacts can have further consequences in altering the resource supply to and behaviour of other organisms within parasitic plant communities.},

In grasslands, this eutrophication causes loss of plant species diversity, but the mechanism of this loss has been difficult to determine. Using experimental grassland plant communities, we found that addition of light to the grassland understory prevented the loss of biodiversity caused by eutrophication. There was no detectable role for competition for soil resources in diversity loss. Thus, competition for light is a major mechanism of plant diversity loss after eutrophication and explains the particular threat of eutrophication to plant diversity. Our conclusions have implications for grassland management and conservation policy and underscore the need to control nutrient enrichment if plant diversity is to be preserved.

	abstract = {Competition for resources has long been considered a prevalent force in structuring plant communities and natural selection, yet our understanding of the mechanisms that underlie resource competition is still developing. The complexity of resource competition is derived not only from the variability of resource limitation in space and time and among species, but also from the complexity of the resources themselves. Nutrients, water and light each differ in their properties, which generates unique ways that plants compete for these resources. Here, we discuss the roles of supply pre-emption and availability reduction in competition for the three resources when supplied evenly in space and time. Plants compete for nutrients by pre-empting nutrient supplies from coming into contact with neighbours, which requires maximizing root length. Although water is also a soil resource, competition for water is generally considered to occur by availability reduction, favouring plants that can withstand the lowest water potential. Because light is supplied from above plants, individuals that situate their leaves above those of neighbours benefit directly from increased photosynthetic rates and indirectly by reducing the growth of those neighbours via shade. In communities where juveniles recruit in the shade of adults, traits of the most competitive species are biased towards those that confer greater survivorship and growth at the juvenile stage, even if those traits come at the expense of adult performance. Understanding the mechanisms of competition also reveals how competition has influenced the evolution of plant species. For example, nutrient competition has selected for plants to maintain higher root length and light competition plants that are taller, with deeper, flatter canopies than would be optimal in the absence of competition. In all, while more research is needed on competition for heterogeneous resource supplies as well as for water, understanding the mechanisms of competition increases the predictability of interspecific interactions and reveals how competition has altered the evolution of plants.},

In this review, we will address various components of competition between plant individuals with a specific focus on molecular aspects. As plant–plant interactions during competition are multiple and complex, we will focus here on a restricted set of examples of plant traits that are thought to enhance their performance during competition. To respond to competition by neighbours, plants first need to detect these competitors in a reliable way. We discuss the various ways of molecular detection of competition through light-quality signals, nutrient levels, soluble root exudates and volatile organic compounds emitted by neighbouring plants. Once perceived, these signals are translated into responses such as shade avoidance, root foraging and allelopathy. We integrate the various molecular patterns of signal detection and subsequent plant responses, both above- and below-ground and including their interaction. We outline research strategies towards creating a general, mechanistic understanding of how plants increase their performance during competition.},

	abstract = {Recent experiments on grassland ecosystems have shown that biodiversity can enhance ecosystem processes such as plant biomass production. Functional complementarity is generally regarded as the main class of mechanisms generating these effects of biodiversity on ecosystem functioning. Although intuitively appealing and supported by some data, the complementarity hypothesis has been little explored theoretically using mechanistic approaches. Here, we present a simple dynamical model for a light-limited terrestrial ecosystem to assess the effects of species diversity on light competition and total biomass in plant communities. Our model shows that competitive relaxation (reduction in average light competition intensity) due to differences in foliar architecture among species enhances total plant biomass in mixtures, but that competitive imbalance (generated by the variance of the average light competition intensity experienced by different species) can either reinforce the effect of competitive relaxation or counteract it and contribute to reducing total plant biomass. Thus, complementary resource use is not enough to increase total plant biomass in species-rich communities; competitive balance among species also plays an important role. We propose an operational measure of light-use complementarity using empirical field data on light absorption to test the presence of complementarity in natural plant communities.},

(2006) reviewed major pressures on freshwater ecosystems, the biodiversity crisis in the world’s lakes, reservoirs, rivers, streams and wetlands has deepened. While lakes, reservoirs and rivers cover only 2.3\% of the Earth’s surface, these ecosystems host at least 9.5\% of the Earth’s described animal species. Furthermore, using the World Wide Fund for Nature’s Living Planet Index, freshwater population declines (83\% between 1970 and 2014) continue to outpace contemporaneous declines in marine or terrestrial systems. The Anthropocene has brought multiple new and varied threats that disproportionately impact freshwater systems. We document 12 emerging threats to freshwater biodiversity that are either entirely new since 2006 or have since intensiﬁed: (i) changing climates; (ii) e-commerce and invasions; (iii) infectious diseases; (iv) harmful algal blooms; (v) expanding hydropower; (vi) emerging contaminants; (vii) engineered nanomaterials; (viii) microplastic pollution; (ix) light and noise; (x) freshwater salinisation; (xi) declining calcium; and (xii) cumulative stressors. Effects are evidenced for amphibians, ﬁshes, invertebrates, microbes, plants, turtles and waterbirds, with potential for ecosystem-level changes through bottom-up and top-down processes. In our highly uncertain future, the net effects of these threats raise serious concerns for freshwater ecosystems. However, we also highlight opportunities for conservation gains as a result of novel management tools (e.g. environmental ﬂows, environmental DNA) and speciﬁc conservation-oriented actions (e.g. dam removal, habitat protection policies, managed relocation of species) that have been met with varying levels of success. Moving forward, we advocate hybrid approaches that manage fresh waters as crucial ecosystems for human life support as well as essential hotspots of biodiversity and ecological function. Efforts to reverse global trends in freshwater degradation now depend on bridging an immense gap between the aspirations of conservation biologists and the accelerating rate of species endangerment.},

	abstract = {Studies on biodiversity and ecosystem functioning (BEF) have elicited debate over the interpretation of the positive relationship between species richness and plant productivity. Manipulating richness cannot be achieved without affecting composition; it is thus essential to consider the latter in statistical models. We firstly review existing approaches that use species richness as an explanatory variable and propose modifications to improve their performance. We use an original data set to illustrate the analyses. The classical method where composition is coded as a factor with a level for each different species mixture can be improved by defining the levels using clustering. Methods based on ordinations reduce the dimensionality of plant composition and use the new coordinates as fixed effects; they provide a much better fit to our observations. Secondly, we develop a new method where composition is included as a similarity matrix affecting the residual variance–covariance. Similarity in composition between plots is treated in the same way as shared evolutionary history between species in phylogenetic regression. We find that it outperforms the other models. We discuss the different approaches and suggest that our method is particularly suited for observational studies or for manipulative studies where plant diversity is not kept constant by weeding. By treating species composition in an intuitive and sensible way, it offers a valuable and powerful complement to existing models.},

	abstract = {Summary Perhaps no other pair of variables in ecology has generated as much discussion as species richness and ecosystem productivity, as illustrated by the reactions by Pierce () and others to Adler et al.'s () report that empirical patterns are weak and inconsistent. Adler et al. () argued we need to move beyond a focus on simplistic bivariate relationships and test mechanistic, multivariate causal hypotheses. We feel the continuing debate over productivity?richness relationships (PRRs) provides a focused context for illustrating the fundamental difficulties of using bivariate relationships to gain scientific understanding. Pierce () disputes Adler et al.'s () conclusion that bivariate productivity?richness relationships (PRRs) are ?weak and variable?. He argues, instead, that relationships in the Adler et al. data are actually strong and, further, that failure to adhere to the humped-back model (HBM; sensu Grime ) threatens scientists' ability to advise conservationists. Here, we show that Pierce's reanalyses are invalid, that statistically significant boundary relations in the Adler et al. data are difficult to detect when proper methods are used and that his advice neither advances scientific understanding nor provides the quantitative forecasts actually needed by decision makers. We begin by examining Grimes' HBM through the lens of causal networks. We first translate the ideas contained in the HBM into a causal diagram, which shows explicitly how multiple processes are hypothesized to control biomass production and richness and their interrelationship. We then evaluate the causal diagram using structural equation modelling and example data from a published study of meadows in Finland. Formal analysis rejects the literal translation of the HBM and reveals additional processes at work. This exercise shows how the practice of abstracting systems as causal networks (i) clarifies possible hypotheses, (ii) permits explicit testing and (iii) provides more powerful and useful predictions. Building on the Finnish meadow example, we contrast the utility of bivariate plots compared with structural equation models for investigating underlying processes. Simulations illustrate the fallibility of bivariate analysis as a means of supporting one theory over another, while models based on causal networks can quantify the sensitivity of diversity patterns to both management and natural constraints. A key piece of Pierce's critique of Adler et al.'s conclusions relies on upper boundary regression which he claims to reveal strong relationships between production and richness in Adler et al.'s original data. We demonstrate that this technique shows strong associations in purely random data and is invalid for Adler et al.'s data because it depends on a uniform data distribution. We instead perform quantile regression on both the site-level summaries of the data and the plot-level data (using mixed-model quantile regression). Using a variety of nonlinear curve-fitting approaches, we were unable to detect a significant humped-shape boundary in the Adler et al. data. We reiterate that the bivariate productivity?richness relationships in Adler et al.'s data are weak and variable. We urge ecologists to consider productivity?richness relationships through the lens of causal networks to advance our understanding beyond bivariate analysis. Further, we emphasize that models based on a causal network conceptualization can also provide more meaningful guidance for conservation management than can a bivariate perspective. Measuring only two variables does not permit the evaluation of complex ideas nor resolve debates about underlying mechanisms.},

	abstract = {THE idea that the connections between species in ecological assemblages are characterized by a trait called 'interaction strength' has become a cornerstone of modern ecology. Since the classic paper of Watt1, ecologists have acknowledged the importance of distinguishing pattern (static community features) from process (dynamically based mechanisms), which can determine the immediate observed details. Food webs display pathways of implied dynamics, and thus potentially unite pattern and process in a single framework2,3. Most analyses4–8 have focused entirely on web topology and the derived descriptive properties. By contrast, attempts to generalize how natural communities are organized9,10 or summary statements about whole communities6,11–13 have emphasized critical processes. Elton's2 insights and May's3generalizations and analyses have stimulated current developments. In May's approach, the idea of interaction strength is precise, reflecting coefficients in a jacobian matrix associated with a community dynamics model. He found striking dependence of community stability both on web complexity and on the number and strength of interactions. By contrast, empiricists have usually determined relative interaction strength from single-species removals analysed by multivariate statistics14,15.I report here the first experimental study designed to estimate interaction strengths in a species-rich herbivore guild, documenting on a per capita basis mainly weak or positive interactions, and a few strong interactions, a pattern which has profound implications for community dynamics.},

	abstract = {Plant-pollinator interaction networks are bipartite networks representing the mutualistic interactions between a set of plant species and a set of pollinator species. Data on these networks are collected by ﬁeld biologists, who count visits from pollinators to ﬂowers. Ecologists study the structure and function of these networks for scientiﬁc, conservation, and agricultural purposes. However, little research has been done to understand the underlying mechanisms that determine pairwise interactions or to predict new links from networks describing the species community. This paper explores the use of latent factor models to predict interactions that will occur in new contexts (e.g. a different distribution of the set of plant species) based on an observed network. The analysis draws on algorithms and evaluation strategies developed for recommendation systems and introduces them to this new domain. The matrix factorization methods compare favorably against several baselines on a pollination dataset collected in montane meadows over several years. Incorporating both positive and negative implicit feedback into the matrix factorization methods is particularly promising.},

	abstract = {Increasing evidence suggests that an appropriate model for food webs, the network of feeding links in a community of species, should take into account the inherent variability of ecological interactions. Harnessing this variability, we will show that it is useful to interpret empirically observed food webs as realisations of a family of stochastic processes, namely random dot-product graph models. These models provide an ideal extension of food-web models beyond the limitations of current deterministic or partially probabilistic models. As an additional beneﬁt, our RDPG framework enables us to identify the pairwise distance structure given by species' functional food-web traits: this allows for the natural emergence of ecologically meaningful species groups. Lastly, our results suggest the notion that the evolutionary signature in food webs is already detectable in their stochastic backbones, while the contribution of their ﬁne wiring is arguable. Synthesis Food webs are influenced by many stochastic processes and are constantly evolving. Here, we treat observed food webs as realisations of random dot-product graph models (RDPG), extending food-web modelling beyond the limitations of current deterministic or partially probabilistic models. Our RDPG framework enables us to identify the pairwise-distance structure given by species' functional food-web traits, which in turn allows for the natural emergence of ecologically meaningful species groups. It also provides a way to measure the phylogenetic signal present in food webs, which we find is strongest in webs' low-dimensional backbones.},

	abstract = {Networks play a prominent role in the study of complex systems of interacting entities in biology, sociology, and economics. Despite this diversity, we demonstrate here that a statistical model decomposing networks into matching and centrality components provides a comprehensive and unifying quantification of their architecture. The matching term quantifies the assortative structure in which node makes links with which other node, whereas the centrality term quantifies the number of links that nodes make. We show, for a diverse set of networks, that this decomposition can provide a tight fit to observed networks. Then we provide three applications. First, we show that the model allows very accurate prediction of missing links in partially known networks. Second, when node characteristics are known, we show how the matching–centrality decomposition can be related to this external information. Consequently, it offers us a simple and versatile tool to explore how node characteristics explain network architecture. Finally, we demonstrate the efficiency and flexibility of the model to forecast the links that a novel node would create if it were to join an existing network.},

However, community ecology studies have mainly focused on simple competition and predation systems, and the relative impact of positive interspecific interactions in shaping communities in a spatial context is not well understood. Here we employ a spatially explicit metacommunity model to investigate the effect of local dispersal on the structure and function of communities in which species are linked through an interaction web comprising mutualism, competition and exploitation. Our results show that function, diversity and interspecific interactions of locally linked communities undergo a phase transition with changes in the rate of species dispersal. We find that low spatial interconnectedness favors the spontaneous emergence of strongly mutualistic communities which are more stable but less productive and diverse. On the other hand, high spatial interconnectedness promotes local biodiversity at the expense of local stability and supports communities with a wide range of interspecific interactions. We argue that investigations of the relationship between spatial processes and the self-organization of complex interaction webs are critical to understanding the geographic structure of interactions in real landscapes.},

	abstract = {Positive interactions are widely recognized as playing a major role in the organization of community structure and diversity. As such, recent theoretical and empirical works have revealed the significant contribution of positive interactions in shaping species’ geographical distributions, particularly in harsh abiotic conditions. In this report, we explore the joint influence of local dispersal and an environmental gradient on the spatial distribution, structure and function of communities containing positive interactions. While most previous theoretical efforts were limited to modelling the dynamics of single pairs of associated species being mutualist or competitor, here we employ a spatially explicit multi-species metacommunity model covering a rich range of interspecific interactions (mutualism, competition and exploitation) along an environmental gradient. We find that mutualistic interactions dominate in communities with low diversity characterized by limited species dispersal and poor habitat quality. On the other hand, the fraction of mutualistic interactions decreases at the expense of exploitation and competition with the increase in diversity caused by higher dispersal and/or habitat quality. Our multi-species model exemplifies the ubiquitous presence of mutualistic interactions and the role of mutualistic species as facilitators for the further establishment of species during ecosystem assembly. We therefore argue that mutualism is an essential component driving the origination of complex and diverse communities.},

	abstract = {Theories based on competition for resources in animals and other non-sessile organisms rarely consider the role of facilitative interactions. Yet these interactions are important for community assembly, especially under stressful environments (e.g. the stress-gradient hypothesis, SGH). To make an explicit link between species interaction theory and SGH patterns, I used a classic resource competition model promoting coexistence between a beneficiary and its facilitator sharing a common resource along a stress gradient. I compared model outcomes for two fundamentally different mechanisms of facilitation (alleviation of resource versus non-resource stress), and also tested the effect of a reciprocal cost of facilitation from the beneficiary. I then tested model's biological relevance using experimental data from two tuber moth species (Lepidoptera, Gelechiidae) for which facilitation in resource access was previously established. Simulation outcomes revealed that both the mode of facilitation and the incorporation of facilitation costs affected the shape of the facilitation–stress relationship. These predictions are in line with current SGH observations and experiments on both plants and animals and reconcile the frequently reported variability of this relationship in nature. Moreover, a sensitivity analysis of model's parameters confirmed the robustness of the modelling framework to uncover the mechanisms responsible for observed species interaction–stress patterns. Finally, when parameterized with tuber moth demographic data, model's results corresponded to observed interaction outcomes along resource stress gradients. Overall, having a common model for plants and animals may simplify assumptions in SGH studies, allow contrasting the shapes of different consumer–resource relationships and specifying the conditions that favour one type of interaction outcome over another.},

	abstract = {There has been considerable recent interest in understanding the role of positive inter-specific interactions within ecology, and significant progress has been made both empirically and theoretically. Similarly, considerable progress has been made in improving our understanding of the mechanisms that limit species’ ranges. In this contribution, we seek to understand the setting of species’ borders when some species within the assemblage exhibit positive inter-specific interactions. We use a spatially explicit dual-lattice simulation model to explore the distribution of different interactions across environmental gradients. We first simulate community dynamics when there is either a gradient in reproductive rate or in mortality. We then consider what happens when gradients in reproduction and mortality run in parallel or perpendicular to one another. If the stress gradient impacts on reproductive potential, positive interactions are found where there is high abiotic stress. In this instance, the mutualists are able to tolerate an environment that the cheaters cannot. However, when the stress gradient influences mortality, we find that the mutualists occur as a stripe surrounded by cheaters both towards the better and the harsher ends of the gradient. Previous theory and most empirical evidence tend to indicate that net positive interactions are likely to occur in environments characterized by high abiotic stress. However, evidence from some stress gradients suggests that the distribution of positive and negative interactions can be more complex, with the most stressful environments being occupied by individuals engaging in negative rather than positive interactions. Our results provide a potential theoretical explanation for these recent field observation, and highlight the need for further theoretical and empirical work to better our understanding of how positive and negative interactions act to determine the limits to species’ ranges.},

	abstract = {Foundation species structure communities, promote biodiversity and stabilize ecosystem processes by creating locally stable environmental conditions. Despite their critical importance, the role of foundation species in stabilizing natural communities has seldom been quantified. In theory, the stability of a foundation species should promote community stability by enhancing species richness, altering the population fluctuations of individual species or both. Here we tested the hypothesis that the stability of a marine foundation species, the giant kelp Macrocystis pyrifera, increased the stability of the aggregate biomass of a phylogenetically diverse assemblage of understory algae and sessile invertebrates that compete for space beneath the giant kelp canopy. To achieve this goal, we analyzed an 18-year time-series of the biomass of giant kelp and its associated benthic community collected from 32 plots distributed among nine shallow reefs in the Santa Barbara Channel, USA. We showed that the stability of understory algae and sessile invertebrates was positively and indirectly related to the stability of giant kelp, which primarily resulted from giant kelp’s direct positive association with species richness. The stability of all community types was positively related to species richness via increased species stability and species asynchrony. The stabilizing effects of richness were three to four times stronger when algae and invertebrates were considered separately rather than in combination. Our finding that diversity-stability relationships were stronger in communities consisting of species with similar resource requirements suggests that competition for shared resources rather than differential responses to environmental conditions played a more important role in stabilizing the community. Increasing threats to structure-forming foundation species worldwide necessitates a detailed understanding of how they influence their associated community. This study is among the first to show that dampened temporal fluctuations in the biomass of a foundation species is an important determinant of the stability of the complex communities it supports.},

Here, we tested short-term responses of dryland plant communities to contrasting rainfall regimes using reciprocal transplants of soil and seed banks. We exposed three annual plant communities to very different climatic conditions along a steep rainfall gradient. We tested for the role of climate versus community origin on community response and resistance. In parallel, we asked whether origin-specific climatic adaptations predict compositional shifts across climates. Due to an extreme drought, all plants in the driest climate failed to reach maturity. For the remaining two community origins, the most dry-adapted species in each community increased in dry climate and the wet-adapted species increased in wet climate. Dry community origins showed large compositional shifts while maintaining stable plant density, biomass and species richness across climates. Conversely, wet communities showed smaller compositional shifts, but larger variation in biomass and richness. This asynchrony in species abundances in response to rainfall variability could maintain structural community stability. This, in combination with seed dormancy, has the ability to delay extinction in response to climate change. However, increasing occurrence of extreme droughts may, in the long-term, lead to loss of wet-adapted species.},

However, environmental change often occurs slowly at broad spatial scales, which requires regional-level assessments of long-term stability. In this study, we assess the stability of macroinvertebrate communities across 105 lakes in the Swedish “lakescape.” Using a hierarchical mixed-model approach, we first evaluate the environmental pressures affecting invertebrate communities in two ecoregions (north, south) using a 23 year time series (1995–2017) and then examine how a set of environmental and physical variables affect the stability of these communities. Results show that lake latitude, size, total phosphorus and alkalinity affect community composition in northern and southern lakes. We find that lake stability is affected by species richness and lake size in both ecoregions and alkalinity and total phosphorus in northern lakes. There is large heterogeneity in the patterns of community stability of individual lakes, but relationships between that stability and environmental drivers begin to emerge when the lakescape, composed of many discrete lakes, is the focal unit of study. The results of this study highlight that broad-scale comparisons in combination with long time series are essential to understand the effects of environmental change on the stability of lake communities in space and time.},

Challenges remain in terms of evaluating the predictability of succession and the reliability of the chronosequence methods typically used to study community development. The research of William S. Cooper in Glacier Bay National Park is an early and well-known example of successional ecology that provides a long-term observational data set to test hypotheses derived from space-for-time substitutions. It also provides a unique opportunity to explore the importance of historical contingencies and as an example of a revitalized historical study system. We test the textbook successional trajectory in Glacier Bay and evaluate long-term plant community development via primary succession through extensive fieldwork, remote sensing, dendrochronological methods, and newly discovered data that fills in data gaps (1940s to late 1980s) in continuous measurement over 100+ years. To date, Cooper's quadrats do not support the classic facilitation model of succession in which a sequence of species interacts to form predictable successional trajectories. Rather, stochastic early community assembly and subsequent inhibition have dominated; most species arrived shortly after deglaciation and have remained stable for 50+ years. Chronosequence studies assuming prior composition are thus questionable, as no predictable species sequence or timeline was observed. This underscores the significance of assumptions about early conditions in chronosequences and the need to defend such assumptions. Furthermore, this work brings a classic study system in ecology up to date via a plot size expansion, new baseline biogeochemical data, and spatial mapping for future researchers for its second century of observation.},

	abstract = {Classically, biomass partitioning across trophic levels was thought to add up to a pyramidal distribution. Numerous exceptions have, however, been noted including complete pyramidal inversions. Elevated levels of biomass top-heaviness (i.e. high consumer/resource biomass ratios) have been reported from Arctic tundra communities to Brazilian phytotelmata, and in species assemblages as diverse as those dominated by sharks and ants. We highlight two major pathways for creating top-heaviness, via: (1) endogenous channels that enhance energy transfer across trophic boundaries within a community and (2) exogenous pathways that transfer energy into communities from across spatial and temporal boundaries. Consumer–resource models and allometric trophic network models combined with niche models reveal the nature of core mechanisms for promoting top-heaviness. Outputs from these models suggest that top-heavy communities can be stable, but they also reveal sources of instability. Humans are both increasing and decreasing top-heaviness in nature with ecological consequences. Current and future research on the drivers of top-heaviness can help elucidate fundamental mechanisms that shape the architecture of ecological communities and govern energy flux within and between communities. Questions emerging from the study of top-heaviness also usefully draw attention to the incompleteness and inconsistency by which ecologists often establish definitional boundaries for communities.},

	abstract = {Collinearity refers to the non independence of predictor variables, usually in a regression-type analysis. It is a common feature of any descriptive ecological data set and can be a problem for parameter estimation because it inflates the variance of regression parameters and hence potentially leads to the wrong identification of relevant predictors in a statistical model. Collinearity is a severe problem when a model is trained on data from one region or time, and predicted to another with a different or unknown structure of collinearity. To demonstrate the reach of the problem of collinearity in ecology, we show how relationships among predictors differ between biomes, change over spatial scales and through time. Across disciplines, different approaches to addressing collinearity problems have been developed, ranging from clustering of predictors, threshold-based pre-selection, through latent variable methods, to shrinkage and regularisation. Using simulated data with five predictor-response relationships of increasing complexity and eight levels of collinearity we compared ways to address collinearity with standard multiple regression and machine-learning approaches. We assessed the performance of each approach by testing its impact on prediction to new data. In the extreme, we tested whether the methods were able to identify the true underlying relationship in a training dataset with strong collinearity by evaluating its performance on a test dataset without any collinearity. We found that methods specifically designed for collinearity, such as latent variable methods and tree based models, did not outperform the traditional GLM and threshold-based pre-selection. Our results highlight the value of GLM in combination with penalised methods (particularly ridge) and threshold-based pre-selection when omitted variables are considered in the final interpretation. However, all approaches tested yielded degraded predictions under change in collinearity structure and the ‘folk lore’-thresholds of correlation coefficients between predictor variables of {\textbar}r{\textbar} {\textgreater}0.7 was an appropriate indicator for when collinearity begins to severely distort model estimation and subsequent prediction. The use of ecological understanding of the system in pre-analysis variable selection and the choice of the least sensitive statistical approaches reduce the problems of collinearity, but cannot ultimately solve them.},

This paper criticizes the practice, building upon recent critiques. 2 Regression of residuals is often used as an alternative to multiple regression, often with the aim of controlling for confounding variables. When correlations exist between independent variables, as is generally the case with ecological datasets, this procedure leads to biased parameter estimates. Standard multiple regression, by contrast, yields unbiased parameter estimates. 3 In multiple regression parameters are estimated controlling for the effects of the other variables in the model, and thus multiple regression achieves what residual regression claims to do. 4 Several measures of correlation exist that differ in the way that variance is partitioned among independent variables. These can be estimated multiply, or sequentially if reasons exist for estimating effects of variables in a hierarchical manner.},

	abstract = {Nationwide in the United States, 70\% of faculty members in higher education are employed off the tenure-track. Nearly all of these non-tenure-track (NTT) appointments share a quality that may produce stress for those who hold them: contingency. Most NTT appointments are contingent on budget, enrollment, or both, and the majority of contingent faculty members are hired for one quarter or semester at a time. Significant research has investigated the effects of contingency on teaching, students, departments, colleges, and universities; however, little research has focused on the psychological experiences of NTT faculty. The current study examined perceptions of workplace stressors and harm, organizational commitment, common coping mechanisms, and depression, anxiety and stress among NTT faculty using a longitudinal design that spanned two to four months. Results indicate that NTT faculty perceive unique stressors at work that are related to their contingent positions. Specific demographic characteristics and coping strategies, inability to find a permanent faculty position, and commitment to one’s organization predispose NTT faculty to perceive greater harm and more sources of stress in their workplaces. Demographic characteristics, lower income, inability to find a permanent faculty position, disengagement coping mechanisms (e.g., giving up, denial), and organizational commitment were associated with the potential for negative outcomes, particularly depression, anxiety, and stress. Our findings suggest possibilities for institutional intervention. Overall, we argue that universities would be well-served by attending to the needs of NTT faculty on campus in order to mitigate negative outcomes for institutions, students, and faculty.},

Despite their significance, alternative attractors have proven to be challenging to detect and characterize in natural communities. On coral reefs, it has been hypothesized that persistent coral-to-macroalgae “phase shifts” that can result from overfishing of herbivores and/or nutrient enrichment may reflect a regime shift to an alternate attractor, but, to date, the evidence has been equivocal. Our field experiments in Moorea, French Polynesia, revealed the following: (i) hysteresis existed in the herbivory–macroalgae relationship, creating the potential for coral–macroalgae bistability at some levels of herbivory, and (ii) macroalgae were an alternative attractor under prevailing conditions in the lagoon but not on the fore reef, where ambient herbivory fell outside the experimentally delineated region of hysteresis. These findings help explain the different community responses to disturbances between lagoon and fore reef habitats of Moorea over the past several decades and reinforce the idea that reversing an undesired shift on coral reefs can be difficult. Our experimental framework represents a powerful diagnostic tool to probe for multiple attractors in ecological systems and, as such, can inform management strategies needed to maintain critical ecosystem functions in the face of escalating stresses.},

	abstract = {Structural equation modeling (SEM) is increasingly being chosen by researchers as a framework for gaining scientific insights from the quantitative analyses of data. New ideas and methods emerging from the study of causality, influences from the field of graphical modeling, and advances in statistics are expanding the rigor, capability, and even purpose of SEM. Guidelines for implementing the expanded capabilities of SEM are currently lacking. In this paper we describe new developments in SEM that we believe constitute a third-generation of the methodology. Most characteristic of this new approach is the generalization of the structural equation model as a causal graph. In this generalization, analyses are based on graph theoretic principles rather than analyses of matrices. Also, new devices such as metamodels and causal diagrams, as well as an increased emphasis on queries and probabilistic reasoning, are now included. Estimation under a graph theory framework permits the use of Bayesian or likelihood methods. The guidelines presented start from a declaration of the goals of the analysis. We then discuss how theory frames the modeling process, requirements for causal interpretation, model specification choices, selection of estimation method, model evaluation options, and use of queries, both to summarize retrospective results and for prospective analyses. The illustrative example presented involves monitoring data from wetlands on Mount Desert Island, home of Acadia National Park. Our presentation walks through the decision process involved in developing and evaluating models, as well as drawing inferences from the resulting prediction equations. In addition to evaluating hypotheses about the connections between human activities and biotic responses, we illustrate how the structural equation (SE) model can be queried to understand how interventions might take advantage of an environmental threshold to limit Typha invasions. The guidelines presented provide for an updated definition of the SEM process that subsumes the historical matrix approach under a graph-theory implementation. The implementation is also designed to permit complex specifications and to be compatible with various estimation methods. Finally, they are meant to foster the use of probabilistic reasoning in both retrospective and prospective considerations of the quantitative implications of the results.},

Data from freshwater fish communities are used to test two related hypotheses. The data presented on fish species diversity from the four major lake basins of Africa support the hypothesis that stable environments have more species than relatively less stable ones. The data presented from a natural perturbation in Panama, the introduction of a predatory fish, refute the hypothesis that stable environments have greater resilience (i.e., faunal stability). In the latter test, predation by an introduced piscivore caused the local extermination of 13 of 17 native fish species in the environmentally stable lake system, but caused no local extermination in the adjacent and relatively less environmentally stable river system. The results provide empirical support for the hypothesis that stable environments, associated with a higher species diversity, will have lower (faunal) stability. It is suggested that system characteristics, such as physical heterogeneity or seasonality, may be more important in determining community species resilience that the number or species diversity of resident species.},

Species richness and density were markedly higher at the more stable sites, but species evenness peaked at sites of intermediate stability. Of the 20 environmental variables examined, a multivariate instability index incorporating temporal variation in depth, temporal variation in current speed, substrate stability, the Pfankuch channel stability index, temperature range, and stream reach tractive force was the single best predictor of the number of species, whereas epilithic pigment concentration was the single best predictor of invertebrate density. The pattern in species richness did not support any of three diversity hypotheses considered. In contrast, the pattern in species evenness suggested competitive exclusion may be occurring patchily and that Hutson's dynamic equilibrium model may have some validity, at least at the level of the patch. However, the strong link between productivity and stability apparent in these habitats, and a lack of information on the effects of increased productivity on competition in stream benthic communities makes any firm assessment of the latter model difficult. The observed diversity patterns are, however, consistent with the idea that high diversity is maintained in these habitats by an interaction between low levels of disturbance and habitat patchiness.},

The operation of hydroelectric facilities can influence both habitat availability and environmental stability in downstream reaches. We evaluated the relative influence of habitat complexity and environmental stability on fish assemblage structure at unregulated and hydropower-regulated reaches of the Flint River in southwestern Georgia. The availability of different habitat types was highly variable at the regulated reach owing to large, daily fluctuations in discharge. Habitat-specific fish assemblages also differed between reaches, as a greater number of species occupied identical habitat types at the unregulated reach, most notably in shallow, slow-flowing habitats. Differences in fish assemblage structure between study reaches in comparable habitat types were explained equally well by patterns of habitat structure and variability. Within-reach patterns of fish assemblage structure were best explained by patterns of habitat structure at both study reaches. However, the relative influence of habitat complexity and habitat stability differed within each study reach, habitat variability influencing fish assemblage structure to a greater extent at the regulated reach than at the unregulated reach. These differences suggest that both habitat structure and variability influence Flint River fish assemblages and that flow regulation associated with hydropower operation primarily affects riverine fish communities by increasing environmental variability. Thus, flow management plans for regulated rivers based on minimum flows may be most effective when implemented in conjunction with plans that reduce the spatial and temporal variability of habitat availability, particularly in shallow, slow-flowing habitats.},

This method of data analysis differs from conventional univariate and multivariate approaches familiar to most biologists in several ways. First, SEMs are multiequational and capable of representing a wide array of complex hypotheses about how system components interrelate. Second, models are typically developed based on theoretical knowledge and designed to represent competing hypotheses about the processes responsible for data structure. Third, SEM is conceptually based on the analysis of covariance relations. Most commonly, solutions are obtained using maximum-likelihood solution procedures, although a variety of solution procedures are used, including Bayesian estimation. Numerous extensions give SEM a very high degree of flexibility in dealing with nonnormal data, categorical responses, latent variables, hierarchical structure, multigroup comparisons, nonlinearities, and other complicating factors. Structural equation modeling allows researchers to address a variety of questions about systems, such as how different processes work in concert, how the influences of perturbations cascade through systems, and about the relative importance of different influences. I present 2 example applications of SEM, one involving interactions among lynx (Lynx pardinus), mongooses (Herpestes ichneumon), and rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus), and the second involving anuran species richness. Many wildlife ecologists may find SEM useful for understanding how populations function within their environments.

	abstract = {Ecologists routinely fit complex models with multiple parameters of interest, where hundreds or more competing models are plausible. To limit the number of fitted models, ecologists often define a model selection strategy composed of a series of stages in which certain features of a model are compared while other features are held constant. Defining these multi-stage strategies requires making a series of decisions, which may potentially impact inferences, but have not been critically evaluated. We begin by identifying key features of strategies, introducing descriptive terms when they did not already exist in the literature. Strategies differ in how they define and order model building stages. Sequential-by-sub-model strategies focus on one sub-model (parameter) at a time with modeling of subsequent sub-models dependent on the selected sub-model structures from the previous stages. Secondary candidate set strategies model sub-models independently and combine the top set of models from each sub-model for selection in a final stage. Build-up approaches define stages across sub-models and increase in complexity at each stage. Strategies also differ in how the top set of models is selected in each stage and whether they use null or more complex sub-model structures for non-target sub-models. We tested the performance of different model selection strategies using four data sets and three model types. For each data set, we determined the 'true' distribution of AIC weights by fitting all plausible models. Then, we calculated the number of models that would have been fitted and the portion of 'true' AIC weight we recovered under different model selection strategies. Sequential-by-sub-model strategies often performed poorly. Based on our results, we recommend using a build-up or secondary candidate sets, which were more reliable and carrying all models within 5–10 AIC of the top model forward to subsequent stages. The structure of non-target sub-models was less important. Multi-stage approaches cannot compensate for a lack of critical thought in selecting covariates and building models to represent competing a priori hypotheses. However, even when competing hypotheses for different sub-models are limited, thousands or more models may be possible so strategies to explore candidate model space reliably and efficiently will be necessary.},

I explored potential explanations for this observation using two simple model formulations for species temporal dynamics. In the Abiotic model, species turnover is governed by the degree of heterogeneity in the environment and the range of species’ tolerances. In this case, more variable conditions lead to lower species richness and higher turnover, but only if the distribution of species’ niche widths and the size of the species pool are independent of the degree of environmental variability. The Biotic model represents direct effects of diversity on turnover through positive or negative feedbacks between diversity and species’ colonization and extinction rates. Declining turnover with increasing richness occurred when higher diversity either facilitated colonization by new species or reduced extinction rates of extant species. Both models could produce the observed pattern of declining turnover at higher diversity under some circumstances, however the conditions for this outcome in the Abiotic model were restrictive and potentially unrealistic. The models provide a process-based framework for understanding the connection between diversity and species turnover through time.},

Despite this complexity, in species-rich systems, a generic pattern emerges from community assembly, relating variability to the abundance of perturbed species. Strikingly, the contrasting contributions of different species abundance classes to variability, driven by different types of perturbations, can lead to opposite diversity–stability patterns.

Despite the huge diversity of ecological communities, they can have unexpected patterns in common. Hatton et al. describe a general scaling law that relates total predator and prey biomass in terrestrial and aquatic animal communities (see the Perspective by Cebrian). They draw on data from many thousands of population counts of animal communities ranging from plankton to large mammals, across a wide range of biomes. They find a ubiquitous pattern of biomass scaling, which may suggest an underlying organization in ecosystems. It seems that communities follow systematic changes in structure and dynamics across environmental gradients.

Structured Abstract
INTRODUCTIONA surprisingly general pattern at very large scales casts light on the link between ecosystem structure and function. We show a robust scaling law that emerges uniquely at the level of whole ecosystems and is conserved across terrestrial and aquatic biomes worldwide. This pattern describes the changing structure and productivity of the predator-prey biomass pyramid, which represents the biomass of communities at different levels of the food chain. Scaling exponents of the relation between predator versus prey biomass and community production versus biomass are often near ¾, which indicates that very different communities of species exhibit similar high-level structure and function. This recurrent community growth pattern is remarkably similar to individual growth patterns and may hint at a basic process that reemerges across levels of organization.
RATIONALEWe assembled a global data set for community biomass and production across 2260 large mammal, invertebrate, plant, and plankton communities. These data reveal two ecosystem-level power law scaling relations: (i) predator biomass versus prey biomass, which indicates how the biomass pyramid changes shape, and (ii) community production versus community biomass, which indicates how per capita productivity changes at a given level in the pyramid. Both relations span a wide range of ecosystems along large-scale biomass gradients. These relations can be linked theoretically to show how pyramid shape depends on flux rates into and out of predator-prey communities. In order to link community-level patterns to individual processes, we examined community size structure and, particularly, how the mean body mass of a community relates to its biomass.
RESULTSAcross ecosystems globally, pyramid structure becomes consistently more bottom-heavy, and per capita production declines with increasing biomass. These two ecosystem-level patterns both follow power laws with near ¾ exponents and are shown to be robust to different methods and assumptions. These structural and functional relations are linked theoretically, suggesting that a common community-growth pattern influences predator-prey interactions and underpins pyramid shape. Several of these patterns are highly regular (R2 {\textgreater} 0.80) and yet are unexpected from classic theories or from empirical relations at the population or individual level. By examining community size structure, we show these patterns emerge distinctly at the ecosystem level and independently from individual near ¾ body-mass allometries.
CONCLUSIONSystematic changes in biomass and production across trophic communities link fundamental aspects of ecosystem structure and function. The striking similarities that are observed across different kinds of systems imply a process that does not depend on system details. The regularity of many of these relations allows large-scale predictions and suggests high-level organization. This community-level growth pattern suggests a systematic form of density-dependent growth and is intriguing given the parallels it exhibits to growth scaling at the individual level, both of which independently follow near ¾ exponents. Although we can make ecosystem-level predictions from individual-level data, we have yet to fully understand this similarity, which may offer insight into growth processes in physiology and ecology across the tree of life. {\textless}img class="fragment-image" aria-describedby="F1-caption" src="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/349/6252/aac6284/F1.medium.gif"/{\textgreater} Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint African large-mammal communities are highly structured.In lush savanna, there are three times more prey per predator than in dry desert, a pattern that is unexpected and systematic.

Ecosystems exhibit surprising regularities in structure and function across terrestrial and aquatic biomes worldwide. We assembled a global data set for 2260 communities of large mammals, invertebrates, plants, and plankton. We find that predator and prey biomass follow a general scaling law with exponents consistently near ¾. This pervasive pattern implies that the structure of the biomass pyramid becomes increasingly bottom-heavy at higher biomass. Similar exponents are obtained for community production-biomass relations, suggesting conserved links between ecosystem structure and function. These exponents are similar to many body mass allometries, and yet ecosystem scaling emerges independently from individual-level scaling, which is not fully understood. These patterns suggest a greater degree of ecosystem-level organization than previously recognized and a more predictive approach to ecological theory.

	abstract = {Temporal dynamics in ecological variables are usually assessed using linear trends or smoothing methods. Those trends qualitatively summarise the increase or decrease in the variable of interest over a given time period. Yet, linear trends do not capture changes in the direction or in the rate of change of indices such as population trajectories, that may typically occur when conditions improve or worsen following conservation actions or environmental disturbances. In a similar way, non-linear methods while aiming to fully characterise population trajectories, fail to end up with a standard classification. Here, we propose and test a simple method to classify the trajectory of a given ecological variable according to its trend and acceleration. Our method is based on fitting a second order polynomial that is used to describe a trajectory according to its direction, velocity, and curvature (accelerated or decelerated). We apply this method to the temporal dynamics of bird populations monitored by the French Breeding Bird Survey as a case study. Using data for more than 100 species monitored from 1989 to 2017 in more than 2000 sites, we show that one quarter of the studied species have dynamics that can be better described by our polynomial approach than typically-used linear analysis. We also show how it can be used to analyse indicators constructed with multi-species indices. Our method can be applied to any type of ecological variable either to classify trajectories of ecological variables in time or trajectories of ecological variables across pressure gradients. Overall, our results suggest a more systematic investigation of non-linear trajectories when analysing the dynamics of ecological variables.},

Our research aims at assessing the effects of species richness on the aboveground biomass and the ecological driver of this relationship in a primary Pinus kesiya forest. We sampled 112 plots of the primary P. kesiya forests in Yunnan Province. The general linear model and the structural equation model were used to estimate relative effects of multivariate factors among aboveground biomass, species richness and the other explanatory variables, including climate moisture index, soil nutrient regime and stand age. We found a positive linear regression relationship between the species richness and aboveground biomass using ordinary least squares regressions. The species richness and soil nutrient regime had no direct significant effect on aboveground biomass. However, the climate moisture index and stand age had direct effects on aboveground biomass. The climate moisture index could be a better link to mediate the relationship between species richness and aboveground biomass. The species richness affected aboveground biomass which was mediated by the climate moisture index. Stand age had direct and indirect effects on aboveground biomass through the climate moisture index. Our results revealed that climate moisture index had a positive feedback in the relationship between species richness and aboveground biomass, which played an important role in a link between biodiversity maintenance and ecosystem functioning. Meanwhile, climate moisture index not only affected positively on aboveground biomass, but also indirectly through species richness. The information would be helpful in understanding the biodiversity-aboveground biomass relationship of a primary P. kesiya forest and for forest management.},

	abstract = {Diversity-manipulation experiments suggest a positive effect of biodiversity on ecosystem properties (EPs), but variable relationships between species richness and EPs have been reported in natural communities. An explanation for this discrepancy is that observed richness–EPs relationships in natural communities change with environment and species functional identities. But how the relationships change along broad-scale climatic gradients has rarely been examined. In this paper, we sampled 848 plots of 20 × 30 m2 from boreal to tropical forests across China. We examined plot biomass with respect to environmental factors, tree species richness and functional group identity (FGI, i.e. evergreen vs deciduous, and coniferous vs broadleaf). Variation partitioning was used to evaluate the relative effects of the three classes of factors. We found that, most of the ‘effects’ (percentage of variation explained) of richness and FGI on forest biomass were shared with environmental factors, but species richness and FGI still revealed significant effects in addition to environment for plots across China. Richness and FGI explained biomass mainly through their shared effects instead of independent effects, suggesting that the positive biodiversity effect is closely associated with a sampling effect. The relative effects of richness, FGI and environment varied latitudinally: the independent effects of environment and richness decreased from boreal to subtropical forests, whereas the total effect of FGI increased. We also found that the slope of richness–biomass relationship decreased monotonically from boreal to subtropical forests, possibly because of decreasing complementarity and increasing competition with increasing productivity. Our results suggest that while species richness does have significant effects on forest biomass it is less important than environmental gradients and other biotic factors in shaping large-scale biomass patterns. We suggest that understanding how and why the diversity–EPs relationships change along climatic gradient would be helpful for a better understanding of real biodiversity effects in natural communities.},

Here, we examined 12 new stream food webs of higher taxonomic resolution and completeness than any previously published data set and combined them with other 10 published stream webs. 2 Compared with most previously published food webs, these stream communities (containing between 22 and 212 species) had more feeding links per species, a higher fraction of intermediate species (0·78–0·88) and lower fractions of top (0·04–0·09) and ‘basal’ species (0·07–0·15). 3 The exponent of the log link-log species relationship (S1·3) differed significantly (ancova: P {\textless} 0·001) from the link-species ‘law’ (S1) and the constant connectance hypothesis (S2). Based on these results, the link scaling law and the constant connectance hypothesis must be rejected for food webs in stream systems. 4 Connectance was markedly lower than previously reported and decreased with web size. We attribute this to the body-size disparity of organisms at the top and the bottom of the web, flow disturbance and to the high physical heterogeneity and complexity of the sedimentary habitat. All these may reduce the fraction of possible feeding links that are realized.},

	abstract = {Few models concern how environmental variables such as temperature affect community structure. Here, we develop a model of how temperature affects food web connectance, a powerful driver of population dynamics and community structure. We use the Arrhenius equation to add temperature dependence of foraging traits to an existing model of food web structure. The model predicts potentially large temperature effects on connectance. Temperature-sensitive food webs exhibit slopes of up to 0.01 units of connectance per 1°C change in temperature. This corresponds to changes in diet breadth of one resource item per 2°C (assuming a food web containing 50 species). Less sensitive food webs exhibit slopes down to 0.0005, which corresponds to about one resource item per 40°C. Relative sizes of the activation energies of attack rate and handling time determine whether warming increases or decreases connectance. Differences in temperature sensitivity are explained by differences between empirical food webs in the body size distributions of organisms. We conclude that models of temperature effects on community structure and dynamics urgently require considerable development, and also more and better empirical data to parameterize and test them.},

This severely limits our ability to predict which species or functional groups will benefit or suffer from nutrient enrichment and to understand the underlying mechanisms5,6,7,8. Here our approach takes ecosystem complexity into account6,9,10 by considering functional diversity at each trophic level11,12,13,14. We conducted a mesocosm experiment to test the effects of nutrient enrichment in a lake ecosystem. We developed a model of intermediate complexity, which separates trophic levels into functional groups according to size and diet. This model successfully predicted the experimental results, whereas linear food-chain models did not. Our model shows the importance of functional diversity and indirect interactions in the response of ecosystems to perturbations, and indicates that new approaches are needed for the management of freshwater ecosystems subject to eutrophication.},

	abstract = {Theoretical and empirical studies have long suggested that stability and complexity are intimately related, but evidence from long-lived systems at large scales is lacking. Stability can either be driven by complex species interactions, or it can be driven by the presence/absence and abundance of a species best able to perform a specific ecosystem function. We use 64 years of stand productivity measures in forest systems composed of four dominant conifer tree species to contrast the effect of species richness and abundance on three stability measures. To perform this contrast, we measured the annual growth increments of {\textgreater}900 trees in mixed and pure forest stands to test three hypotheses: increased species richness will (1) decrease stand variance, (2) increase stand resistance to drought events, and (3) increase stand resilience to drought events. In each case, the alternate hypothesis was that species richness had no effect, but that species composition and abundance within a stand drove variance, resistance, and resilience. In pure stands, the four species demonstrated significant differences in productivity, and in their resistance and resilience to drought events. The two pine species were the most drought resistant and resilient, whereas mountain hemlock was the least resistant and resilient, and red fir was intermediate. For community measures we found a moderately significant (P = 0.08) increase in the community coefficient of variation and a significant (P = 0.03) increase in resilience with increased species richness, but no significant relationship between species richness and community resistance, though the variance in community resistance to drought decreased with species richness. Community resistance to drought was significantly (P = 0.001) correlated to the relative abundance of lodgepole pine, the most resistant species. We propose that resistance is driven by competition for a single limiting resource, with negative diversity effects. In contrast resilience measures the capacity of communities to partition resources in the absence of a single limiting resource, demonstrating positive diversity effects.},

Dispersal among populations and synchronous stochastic effects (the so called “Moran effect”) are the mechanisms most likely to explain such synchrony patterns. Very few studies have related the degree of spatial synchrony to the biological characteristics of species. Here we present a case where specific predictions can be made to relate river fish species characteristics and synchrony determined exclusively by a Moran effect through the expected sensitivity of species to the regional component of environmental stochasticity. By analyzing 23-year time series of abundance estimates in two isolated localities we show that species associated with synchronized reproduction during the wet season, high fecundity, small egg size and high gonado-somatic index (the so called “periodic” strategy) have a higher degree of spatial synchrony in population dynamics than species associated with the opposite traits (the so called “equilibrium” strategy). This is supported by significant relationships (P values {\textless}0.01) between species traits and the levels of synchrony after removing taxonomical relatedness. Spatial synchrony computed from summed annual total catches by groups of species, separated into strategy types also showed a significantly higher degree of synchrony for the periodic (r=0.83) than the equilibrium (r=0.46) group. Regional hydrological variability is likely to be partly responsible for the observed synchrony pattern and a regional discharge index showed better relationships with the periodic group, supporting the expected differential effect of regional environmental correlation on population dynamics.},

	abstract = {The relationships between biodiversity and stability were determined for both population and ecosystem traits in a long—term study of 207 grassland plots. Results demonstrate that biodiversity stabilizes community and ecosystem processes, but not population processes. Specifically, year—to—year variability in total aboveground plant community biomass was significantly lower in plots with greater plant species richness both for the entire 11—yr period and for the nine non—drought years. The change in total plant community biomass from before the drought to the peak of the drought was also highly dependent on species richness. For all three measures of total community biomass stability, multiple regressions that controlled for covariates showed similar significant relationships between plant diversity and stability. In contrast, year—to—year variability in species abundances was not stabilized by plant species richness for either all years or non—drought years. This difference between species vs. community biomass likely results from interspecific competition. When climatic variations harm some species, unharmed competitors increase. Such compensatory increases stabilize total community biomass, but cause species abundances to be more variable. These results support both the predictions of Robert May concerning the effects of diversity on population stability and the diversity—stability hypothesis as applied to community and ecosystem processes, thus helping to reconcile a long—standing dispute.},

However, the effect of diversity on the stability of the individual populations within the community remains unclear. Some models predict a decrease of population stability with diversity, whereas others suggest that diversity has a stabilizing effect on populations. Empirical evidence for either relationship between population stability and diversity is weak. The few studies that directly assessed the stability of populations reported contradicting results. We used a six-year data-set from a plant diversity experiment to examine the relationships between diversity and temporal stability of plant biomass. Our results show that stability increased with diversity at the community-level, while the stability of populations, averaged over all species, decreased with diversity. However, when examining species separately we found positive, negative and neutral relationships between population stability and diversity. Our findings suggest that diversity may contribute to the stability of ecosystem services at the community level, but the effect of diversity on the stability of the individual populations within the community are generally negative. However, different species within the community may show strikingly different relationships between diversity and stability.},

	abstract = {Recent theoretical and experimental work provides clear evidence that biodiversity loss can have profound impacts on functioning of natural and managed ecosystems and the ability of ecosystems to deliver ecological services to human societies. Work on simplified ecosystems in which the diversity of a single trophic level is manipulated shows that diversity can enhance ecosystem processes such as primary productivity and nutrient retention. Theory also strongly suggests that biodiversity can act as biological insurance against potential disruptions caused by environmental changes. However, these studies generally concern a single trophic level, primary producers for the most part. Changes in biodiversity also affect ecosystem functioning through trophic interactions. Here we review, through the analysis of a simple ecosystem model, several key aspects inherent in multitrophic systems that may strongly affect the relationship between diversity and ecosystem processes. Our analysis shows that trophic interactions have a strong impact on the relationships between diversity and ecosystem functioning, whether the ecosystem property considered is total biomass or temporal variability of biomass at the various trophic levels. In both cases, food-web structure and trade-offs that affect interaction strength have major effects on these relationships. Multitrophic interactions are expected to make biodiversity–ecosystem functioning relationships more complex and non-linear, in contrast to the monotonic changes predicted for simplified systems with a single trophic level.},

Here we use a well-replicated field experiment, in which species diversity was directly controlled, to show that ecosystem productivity in 147 grassland plots increased significantly with plant biodiversity. Moreover, the main limiting nutrient, soil mineral nitrogen, was utilized more completely when there was a greater diversity of species, leading to lower leaching loss of nitrogen from these ecosystems. Similarly, in nearby native grassland, plant productivity and soil nitrogen utilization increased with increasing plant species richness. This supports the diversity–productivity and diversity–sustainability hypotheses. Our results demonstrate that the loss of species threatens ecosystem functioning and sustainability.},

The accumulation of N in living plant biomass was significantly increased by the presence of legumes, C4 grasses, and their combined presence. Thus, these results provide clear evidence for the increasing effects of complementarity through time and suggest a mechanism whereby diversity increases complementarity through the increased input and retention of N, a commonly limiting nutrient.},

Several experiments have provided evidence that reduced species diversity may impair ecosystem processes such as plant biomass production1,2,3,4,5. The interpretation of these experiments, however, has been controversial6,7,8,9,10,11,12 because two types of mechanism may operate in combination6,13,14,15. In the ‘selection effect’, dominance by species with particular traits affects ecosystem processes. In the ‘complementarity effect’, resource partitioning or positive interactions lead to increased total resource use. Here we present a new approach to separate the two effects on the basis of an additive partitioning analogous to the Price equation in evolutionary genetics16,17,18,19. Applying this method to data from the pan-European BIODEPTH experiment4 reveals that the selection effect is zero on average and varies from negative to positive in different localities, depending on whether species with lower- or higher-than-average biomass dominate communities. In contrast, the complementarity effect is positive overall, supporting the hypothesis that plant diversity influences primary production in European grasslands through niche differentiation or facilitation.},

We suggest that, if predators are larger than their prey, a trophic hierarchy can be generated on the basis of body size Empirical evidence from the literature shows that there is a positive relationship between predator and prey size for a range of invertebrates and that predators are usually larger than their prey. Using experimental data on an aquatic food web we show that body size can lead to the type of trophic hierarchy used in the cascade model, suggesting that many food web patterns may be a product of body size.

This paper presents a model, the only successful one among several attempts, in which the first two of these empirical generalizations can be derived as a consequence of the third.

	abstract = {Ecologists and evolutionary biologists rely on an increasingly sophisticated set of statistical tools to describe complex natural systems. One such tool that has gained significant traction in the biological sciences is structural equation models (SEM), a form of path analysis that resolves complex multivariate relationships among a suite of interrelated variables. Evaluation of SEMs has historically relied on covariances among variables, rather than the values of the data points themselves. While this approach permits a wide variety of model forms, it limits the incorporation of detailed specifications. Recent developments have allowed for the simultaneous implementation of non-normal distributions, random effects and different correlation structures using local estimation, but this process is not yet automated and consequently, evaluation can be prohibitive with complex models. Here, I present a fully documented, open-source package piecewiseSEM, a practical implementation of confirmatory path analysis for the r programming language. The package extends this method to all current (generalized) linear, (phylogenetic) least-square, and mixed effects models, relying on familiar r syntax. I also provide two worked examples: one involving random effects and temporal autocorrelation, and a second involving phylogenetically independent contrasts. My goal is to provide a user-friendly and tractable implementation of SEM that also reflects the ecological and methodological processes generating data.},

In this framework, plots take on the role of test statistics, and human cognition the role of statistical tests. Statistical significance of ‘discoveries’ is measured by having the human viewer compare the plot of the real dataset with collections of plots of simulated datasets. A simple but rigorous protocol that provides inferential validity is modelled after the ‘lineup’ popular from criminal legal procedures. Another protocol modelled after the ‘Rorschach’ inkblot test, well known from (pop-)psychology, will help analysts acclimatize to random variability before being exposed to the plot of the real data. The proposed protocols will be useful for exploratory data analysis, with reference datasets simulated by using a null assumption that structure is absent. The framework is also useful for model diagnostics in which case reference datasets are simulated from the model in question. This latter point follows up on previous proposals. Adopting the protocols will mean an adjustment in working procedures for data analysts, adding more rigour, and teachers might find that incorporating these protocols into the curriculum improves their students’ statistical thinking.},

The rate and shape of these coextinction cascades depend very much on the structure of the networks of interactions across species. Understanding network structure and how it relates to network disassembly, therefore, is a priority for system-level conservation biology. This process of network collapse may indeed be related to the process of network build-up, although very little is known about both processes and even less about their relationship. Here we review recent work that provides some preliminary answers to these questions. First, we focus on network assembly by emphasizing temporal processes at the species level, as well as the structural building blocks of complex ecological networks. Second, we focus on network disassembly as a consequence of species extinctions or habitat loss. We conclude by emphasizing some general rules of thumb that can help in building a comprehensive framework to understand the responses of ecological networks to global change.},

GGM are unfortunately badly suited to sparse count data spanning several orders of magnitude. Most inference methods for count data (SparCC, REBACCA, SPIEC-EASI, gCoda, etc) ﬁrst transform counts to pseudo-Gaussian observations before using GGM. We rely instead on a PoissonLogNormal (PLN) model where counts follow Poisson distributions with parameters sampled from a latent multivariate Gaussian variable, and infer the network in the latent space using a variational inference procedure. This model allows us to (i) control for confounding covariates and differences in sampling efforts and (ii) integrate data sets from different origins. It is also competitive in terms of speed and accuracy with state of the art methods.},

We constructed food webs using two size fractions of organisms that differed in individual mass by approximately two orders of magnitude. We measured total biomass and respiration (total CO2 production) as two aspects of ecosystem functioning. We also compared these size-dependent patterns in functioning across two levels of species richness. Initially, organism size strongly influenced total community biomass. With time, however, biomass and respiration eventually converged in communities dominated by large or small species. We conclude that after sufficient time for community development any differences in ecosystem functioning resulted from differences in community composition, including species richness, but not the size of the dominant organisms.},

	abstract = {Recent experiments, mainly in terrestrial environments, have provided evidence of the functional importance of biodiversity to ecosystem processes and properties. Compared to terrestrial systems, aquatic ecosystems are characterised by greater propagule and material exchange, often steeper physical and chemical gradients, more rapid biological processes and, in marine systems, higher metazoan phylogenetic diversity. These characteristics limit the potential to transfer conclusions derived from terrestrial experiments to aquatic ecosystems whilst at the same time provide opportunities for testing the general validity of hypotheses about effects of biodiversity on ecosystem functioning. Here, we focus on a number of unique features of aquatic experimental systems, propose an expansion to the scope of diversity facets to be considered when assessing the functional consequences of changes in biodiversity and outline a hierarchical classification scheme of ecosystem functions and their corresponding response variables. We then briefly highlight some recent controversial and newly emerging issues relating to biodiversity-ecosystem functioning relationships. Based on lessons learnt from previous experimental and theoretical work, we finally present four novel experimental designs to address largely unresolved questions about biodiversity-ecosystem functioning relationships. These include (1) investigating the effects of non-random species loss through the manipulation of the order and magnitude of such loss using dilution experiments; (2) combining factorial manipulation of diversity in interconnected habitat patches to test the additivity of ecosystem functioning between habitats; (3) disentangling the impact of local processes from the effect of ecosystem openness via factorial manipulation of the rate of recruitment and biodiversity within patches and within an available propagule pool; and (4) addressing how non-random species extinction following sequential exposure to different stressors may affect ecosystem functioning. Implementing these kinds of experimental designs in a variety of systems will, we believe, shift the focus of investigations from a species richness-centred approach to a broader consideration of the multifarious aspects of biodiversity that may well be critical to understanding effects of biodiversity changes on overall ecosystem functioning and to identifying some of the potential underlying mechanisms involved.},

Body size distributions are often used to describe structure and energy flux in communities and ecosystems. 2 If clear relationships can be established between body size and trophic level in fishes, they may provide a basis for integrating community and ecosystem analyses based on size spectra, food webs and life histories. 3 We investigated relationships between the body sizes (weight and length) of north-east Atlantic fishes and their trophic level. The abundance of 15N, as determined by stable isotope analysis, was used as an index of trophic level. 4 Cross-species and comparative analyses demonstrated that body size was unrelated or weakly related to trophic level. Thus allometric relationships between body size and trophic level could not be used to predict the trophic structure of fish communities. 5 The results of the cross-species analyses contrasted with patterns in the size and trophic structure of entire fish communities. When fish communities were divided into size classes, there were strong positive relationships between size class and trophic level. The slope suggested a mean predator : prey body mass ratio of 80 : 1. 6 Our results suggest that body size does not provide a useful surrogate of trophic level for individual species, but that body size is an excellent predictor of trophic level within the community, providing an empirical basis for integrating community analyses based on models of trophic structure and body size distributions.},

The two models that address plant nutrient competition also predict that ecosystem nutrient retention increases with biodiversity and that the effects of biodiversity on productivity and nutrient retention increase with interspecific differences in resource requirements. All three models show that both species identity and biodiversity simultaneously influence ecosystem functioning, but their relative importance varies greatly among the models.

	abstract = {Recent experiments have provided some evidence that loss of biodiversity may impair the functioning and sustainability of ecosystems. However, we still lack adequate theories and models to provide robust generalizations, predictions, and interpretations for such results. Here I present a mechanistic model of a spatially structured ecosystem in which plants compete for a limiting soil nutrient. This model shows that plant species richness does not necessarily enhance ecosystem processes, but it identifies two types of factors that could generate such an effect: (i) complementarity among species in the space they occupy below ground and (ii) positive correlation between mean resource-use intensity and diversity. In both cases, the model predicts that plant biomass, primary productivity, and nutrient retention all increase with diversity, similar to results reported in recent field experiments. These two factors, however, have different implications for the understanding of the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. The model also shows that the effect of species richness on productivity or other ecosystem processes is masked by the effects of physical environmental parameters on these processes. Therefore, comparisons among sites cannot reveal it, unless abiotic conditions are very tightly controlled. Identifying and separating out the mechanisms behind ecosystem responses to biodiversity should become the focus of future experiments.},

	abstract = {In theoretical studies, the most commonly used measure of ecological stability is resilience: ecosystems asymptotic rate of return to equilibrium after a pulse-perturbation -or shock. A complementary notion of growing popularity is reactivity: the strongest initial response to shocks. On the other hand, empirical stability is often quantiﬁed as the inverse of temporal variability, directly estimated on data, and reﬂecting ecosystems response to persistent and erratic environmental disturbances. It is unclear whether and how this empirical measure is related to resilience and reactivity. Here, we establish a connection by introducing two variability-based stability measures belonging to the theoretical realm of resilience and reactivity. We call them intrinsic, stochastic and deterministic invariability; respectively deﬁned as the inverse of the strongest stationary response to white-noise and to single-frequency perturbations. We prove that they predict ecosystems worst response to broad classes of disturbances, including realistic models of environmental ﬂuctuations. We show that they are intermediate measures between resilience and reactivity and that, although deﬁned with respect to persistent perturbations, they can be related to the whole transient regime following a shock, making them more integrative notions than reactivity and resilience. We argue that invariability measures constitute a stepping stone, and discuss the challenges ahead to further unify theoretical and empirical approaches to stability.},

	abstract = {Several theoretical studies propose that biodiversity buffers ecosystem functioning against environmental fluctuations, but virtually all of these studies concern a single trophic level, the primary producers. Changes in biodiversity also affect ecosystem processes through trophic interactions. Therefore, it is important to understand how trophic interactions affect the relationship between biodiversity and the stability of ecosystem processes. Here we present two models to investigate this issue in ecosystems with two trophic levels. The first is an analytically tractable symmetrical plant‐herbivore model under random environmental fluctuations, while the second is a mechanistic ecosystem model under periodic environmental fluctuations. Our analysis shows that when diversity affects net species interaction strength, species interactions—both competition among plants and plant‐herbivore interactions—have a strong impact on the relationships between diversity and the temporal variability of total biomass of the various trophic levels. More intense plant competition leads to a stronger decrease or a lower increase in variability of total plant biomass, but plant‐herbivore interactions always have a destabilizing effect on total plant biomass. Despite the complexity generated by trophic interactions, biodiversity should still act as biological insurance for ecosystem processes, except when mean trophic interaction strength increases strongly with diversity.},

The historical review traces the developments of the respective concepts. The meta-analysis explores 3929 weight–length relationships of the type W = aLb for 1773 species of fishes. It shows that 82\% of the variance in a plot of log a over b can be explained by allometric versus isometric growth patterns and by different body shapes of the respective species. Across species median b = 3.03 is significantly larger than 3.0, thus indicating a tendency towards slightly positive-allometric growth (increase in relative body thickness or plumpness) in most fishes. The expected range of 2.5 {\textless} b {\textless} 3.5 is confirmed. Mean estimates of b outside this range are often based on only one or two weight–length relationships per species. However, true cases of strong allometric growth do exist and three examples are given. Within species, a plot of log a vs b can be used to detect outliers in weight–length relationships. An equation to calculate mean condition factors from weight–length relationships is given as Kmean = 100aLb−3. Relative weight Wrm = 100W/(amLbm) can be used for comparing the condition of individuals across populations, where am is the geometric mean of a and bm is the mean of b across all available weight–length relationships for a given species. Twelve recommendations for proper use and presentation of weight–length relationships, condition factors and relative weight are given.},

In the particular case of isometry when the measures are of identical dimension, this normalization coincides with ratios (one of the most popular methods but only valid in this particular case).

	abstract = {Ulrich Brose Body size is recognized as an important determinant of trophic structure as it affects individual energetic demands, population density, and the interaction between potential prey and predators. However, its relationship with trophic position remains unclear. It has been hypothesized that a positive relationship between body size and trophic position would be associated to some particular trophic structures, which would allow larger organisms to satisfy their energetic demand and sustain viable population sizes at higher trophic positions, where fewer resources are available. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed the diet of 619 killifishes from four species (Austrolebias cheradophilus, A. luteoflammulatus, A. viarius and Cynopoecilus melanotaenia), collected in temporary ponds occurring in the grasslands of Rocha, Uruguay. Trophic position, diet richness, number of energy sources, and evenness were estimated for 20 size classes, formed by consecutive groups of 31 individuals. Gape limitation and preference for the larger available prey were evaluated as explanations for observed patterns with an individual based model (IBM). In agreement with the hypothesis, killifishes presented a strong positive relationship between trophic position and body size (R2=0.86), associated with a trophic structure that could allow larger organisms to have access to more energy from the environment. This was reflected in a positive relationship between body size and 1) prey richness, 2) number of basal energy sources (i.e. plants, detritus, phytoplankton and terrestrial prey), and 3) evenness in prey use. IBM results showed that changes in trophic structure with body size are well explained by gape limitation, but not by size preferences. Our results suggest that the fulfilment of the greater energetic demands of larger organism will depend on community diversity, which typically increases with ecosystem size, indicating a novel connection between area, diversity, body size, and food chain length.},

With this model we also show that an increase in the zooplankton growth rate may entail a sequence of bifurcations in the sh population dynamics: steady states → regular oscillations → quasicycles → dynamic chaos. Since aquatic, and in particular, lake ecosystems are spatially heterogeneous, they are often considered as consisting of separate habitats, which are distinguished by their hydrophysical and ecological characteristics. We show that interhabitat sh migration can lead to dramatic changes in the sh population dynamics.

	abstract = {Summary Current global changes make it important to be able to predict which interactions will occur in the emerging ecosystems. Most of the current methods to infer the existence of interactions between two species require a good knowledge of their behaviour or a direct observation of interactions. In this paper, we overcome these limitations by developing a method, inspired from the niche model of food web structure, using the statistical relationship between predator and prey body size to infer the matrix of potential interactions among a pool of species. The novelty of our approach is to infer, for any species of a given species pool, the three species-specific parameters of the niche model. The method applies to both local and metaweb scales. It allows one to evaluate the feeding interactions of a new species entering the community. We find that this method gives robust predictions of the structure of food webs and that its efficiency is increased when the strength of the body–size relationship between predators and preys increases. We finally illustrate the potential of the method to infer the metaweb structure of pelagic fishes of the Mediterranean sea under different global change scenarios.},

	abstract = {Abstract Understanding how biodiversity affects functioning of ecosystems requires integrating diversity within trophic levels (horizontal diversity) and across trophic levels (vertical diversity, including food chain length and omnivory). We review theoretical and experimental progress toward this goal. Generally, experiments show that biomass and resource use increase similarly with horizontal diversity of either producers or consumers. Among prey, higher diversity often increases resistance to predation, due to increased probability of including inedible species and reduced efficiency of specialist predators confronted with diverse prey. Among predators, changing diversity can cascade to affect plant biomass, but the strength and sign of this effect depend on the degree of omnivory and prey behaviour. Horizontal and vertical diversity also interact: adding a trophic level can qualitatively change diversity effects at adjacent levels. Multitrophic interactions produce a richer variety of diversity-functioning relationships than the monotonic changes predicted for single trophic levels. This complexity depends on the degree of consumer dietary generalism, trade-offs between competitive ability and resistance to predation, intraguild predation and openness to migration. Although complementarity and selection effects occur in both animals and plants, few studies have conclusively documented the mechanisms mediating diversity effects. Understanding how biodiversity affects functioning of complex ecosystems will benefit from integrating theory and experiments with simulations and network-based approaches.},

	abstract = {Understanding how biodiversity affects functioning of ecosystems requires integrating diversity within trophic levels (horizontal diversity) and across trophic levels (vertical diversity, including food chain length and omnivory). We review theoretical and experimental progress toward this goal. Generally, experiments show that biomass and resource use increase similarly with horizontal diversity of either producers or consumers. Among prey, higher diversity often increases resistance to predation, due to increased probability of including inedible species and reduced efﬁciency of specialist predators confronted with diverse prey. Among predators, changing diversity can cascade to affect plant biomass, but the strength and sign of this effect depend on the degree of omnivory and prey behaviour. Horizontal and vertical diversity also interact: adding a trophic level can qualitatively change diversity effects at adjacent levels. Multitrophic interactions produce a richer variety of diversity-functioning relationships than the monotonic changes predicted for single trophic levels. This complexity depends on the degree of consumer dietary generalism, trade-offs between competitive ability and resistance to predation, intraguild predation and openness to migration. Although complementarity and selection effects occur in both animals and plants, few studies have conclusively documented the mechanisms mediating diversity effects. Understanding how biodiversity affects functioning of complex ecosystems will beneﬁt from integrating theory and experiments with simulations and network-based approaches.},

Our aim was to identify the determinants of food-web structure with particular reference to energy availability (related to land use), spatial heterogeneity and ecosystem size (both independent of land use). Forested streams displayed lower algal productivity and higher standing crops of organic matter than the grassland streams. The organic matter in the pine streams was probably of lower quality than that elsewhere. Measures of energy availability and spatial heterogeneity predicted species richness and connectance. A combination of energy availability, spatial heterogeneity and ecosystem size accounted for the representation of particular invertebrate feeding groups in the streams. Algal production and organic matter standing crop were important determinants of invertebrate biomass and overall food-web structure. Grassland sites showed a positive relationship between algal productivity and food chain length whereas forest sites displayed a positive relationship between ecosystem size and food chain length. Therefore, these results provide support for both Pimm's productivity hypothesis and Cohen and Newman's ecosystem size hypothesis.},

	abstract = {Body size determines key ecological and evolutionary processes of organisms. Therefore, organisms undergo extensive shifts in resources, competitors, and predators as they grow in body size. While empirical and theoretical evidence show that these size-dependent ontogenetic shifts vastly influence the structure and dynamics of populations, theory on how those ontogenetic shifts affect the structure and dynamics of ecological networks is still virtually absent. Here, we expand the Allometric Trophic Network (ATN) theory in the context of aquatic food webs to incorporate size-structure in the population dynamics of fish species. We do this by modifying a food web generating algorithm, the niche model, to produce food webs where different fish life-history stages are described as separate nodes which are connected through growth and reproduction. Then, we apply a bioenergetic model that uses the food webs and the body sizes generated by our niche model to evaluate the effect of incorporating life-history structure into food web dynamics. We show that the larger the body size of a fish species respective to the body size of its preys, the higher the biomass attained by the fish species and the greater the ecosystem stability. We also find that the larger the asymptotic body size attained by fish species the larger the total ecosystem biomass, a result that holds true for both the largest fish in the ecosystem and each fish species in the ecosystem. This work provides an expanded ATN theory that generates food webs with life-history structure for chosen species. Our work offers a systematic approach for disentangling the effects of increasing life-history complexity in food-web models.},

This proposition first envisioned by Forbes (1907) and then Diamond (1975) prompted the development of numerous modelling approaches (e.g. null model analysis, co-occurrence networks and, more recently, joint species distribution models). Both theory and experimental evidence support the idea that ecological interactions may affect co-occurrence, but it remains unclear to what extent the signal of interaction can be captured in observational data. It is now time to step back from the statistical developments and critically assess whether co-occurrence data are really a proxy for ecological interactions. In this paper, we present a series of arguments based on probability, sampling, food web and coexistence theories supporting that significant spatial associations between species (or lack thereof) is a poor proxy for ecological interactions. We discuss appropriate interpretations of co-occurrence, along with potential avenues to extract as much information as possible from such data.},

	abstract = {One challenge in merging community and ecosystem ecology is to integrate the complexity of natural multitrophic communities into concepts of ecosystem functioning. Here, we combine food-web and allometry theories to demonstrate that primary production, as measured by the total nutrient uptake of the multitrophic community, is determined by vertical diversity (i.e. food web's maximum trophic level) and structure (i.e. distributions of species and their abundances and metabolic rates across trophic levels). In natural ecosystems, the community size distribution determines all these vertical patterns and thus the total nutrient uptake. Our model suggests a vertical diversity hypothesis (VDH) for ecosystem functioning in complex food webs. It predicts that, under a given nutrient supply, the total nutrient uptake increases exponentially with the maximum trophic level in the food web and it increases with its maximum body size according to a power law. The VDH highlights the effect of top–down regulation on plant nutrient uptake, which complements traditional paradigms that emphasised the bottom–up effect of nutrient supply on vertical diversity. We conclude that the VDH contributes to a synthetic framework for understanding the relationship between vertical diversity and ecosystem functioning in food webs and predicting the impacts of global changes on multitrophic ecosystems.},

High animal diversity increases complementarity of herbivores but also increases feeding rates within the consumer guild. Depending on the balance of these counteracting mechanisms, species-rich animal communities may put plants under top-down control or may release them from grazing pressure. Using a dynamic food-web model with body-mass constraints, we simulate ecosystem functions of 20,000 communities of varying animal diversity. We show that diverse animal communities accumulate more biomass and are more exploitative on plants, despite their higher rates of intra-guild predation. However, they do not reduce plant biomass because the communities are composed of larger, and thus energetically more efficient, plant and animal species. This plasticity of community body-size structure reconciles the debate on the consequences of animal species loss for primary productivity.},

	abstract = {Global warming can affect all levels of biological complexity, though we currently understand least about its potential impact on communities and ecosystems. At the ecosystem level, warming has the capacity to alter the structure of communities and the rates of key ecosystem processes they mediate. Here we assessed the effects of a 4°C rise in temperature on the size structure and taxonomic composition of benthic communities in aquatic mesocosms, and the rates of detrital decomposition they mediated. Warming had no effect on biodiversity, but altered community size structure in two ways. In spring, warmer systems exhibited steeper size spectra driven by declines in total community biomass and the proportion of large organisms. By contrast, in autumn, warmer systems had shallower size spectra driven by elevated total community biomass and a greater proportion of large organisms. Community-level shifts were mirrored by changes in decomposition rates. Temperature-corrected microbial and macrofaunal decomposition rates reflected the shifts in community structure and were strongly correlated with biomass across mesocosms. Our study demonstrates that the 4°C rise in temperature expected by the end of the century has the potential to alter the structure and functioning of aquatic ecosystems profoundly, as well as the intimate linkages between these levels of ecological organization.},

	abstract = {Environmental warming is predicted to rise dramatically over the next century, yet few studies have investigated its effects in natural, multi-species systems. We present data collated over an 8-year period from a catchment of geothermally heated streams in Iceland, which acts as a natural experiment on the effects of warming across different organisational levels and spatiotemporal scales. Body sizes and population biomasses of individual species responded strongly to temperature, with some providing evidence to support temperature–size rules. Macroinvertebrate and meiofaunal community composition also changed dramatically across the thermal gradient. Interactions within the warm streams in particular were characterised by food chains linking algae to snails to the apex predator, brown trout. These chains were missing from the colder systems, where snails were replaced by much smaller herbivores and invertebrate omnivores were the top predators. Trout were also subsidised by terrestrial invertebrate prey, which could have an effect analogous to apparent competition within the aquatic prey assemblage. Top-down effects by snails on diatoms were stronger in the warmer streams, which could account for a shallowing of mass–abundance slopes across the community. This may indicate reduced energy transfer efficiency from resources to consumers in the warmer systems and/or a change in predator–prey mass ratios. All the ecosystem process rates investigated increased with temperature, but with differing thermal sensitivities, with important implications for overall ecosystem functioning (e.g. creating potential imbalances in elemental fluxes). Ecosystem respiration rose rapidly with temperature, leading to increased heterotrophy. There were also indications that food web stability may be lower in the warmer streams.},

Development and exploitation mean that they are faced with stresses from a number of anthropogenic sources. Such stresses are typically studied in isolation, but multiple stressors can combine in unexpected ways to alter the structure of ecological systems. Here, we experimentally explore the impacts of inorganic nutrients and organic matter on a range of food web properties. We find that these two stressors combine additively to produce significant increases in connectance and mean food chain length. Such increases are typically associated with enhanced robustness to secondary extinctions and productivity, respectively. Despite these apparent beneficial effects, we find a simplification of web structure in terms of taxon richness and diversity, and altered proportions of basal and top species. These effects are driven by a reduction in community assembly and lower consistency in a range of system properties as a result of the multiple stressors. Consequently, impacted food webs are likely to be more vulnerable to human- or climate-induced perturbations in the long term.},

We manipulated grazer diversity in seagrass mesocosms with and without a generalist predator and monitored community development. Changing food chain length altered biodiversity effects: higher grazer diversity enhanced secondary production, epiphyte grazing, and seagrass biomass only with predators present. Conversely, changing diversity altered top-down control: predator impacts on grazer and seagrass biomass were weaker in mixed-grazer assemblages. These interactions resulted in part from among-species trade-offs between predation resistance and competitive ability. Despite weak impact on grazer abundance at high diversity, predators nevertheless enhanced algal biomass through a behaviourally mediated trophic cascade. Moreover, predators influenced every measured variable except total plant biomass, suggesting that the latter is an insensitive metric of ecosystem functioning. Thus, biodiversity and trophic structure interactively influence ecosystem functioning, and neither factor's impact is predictable in isolation.},

	abstract = {The efficiency of energy transfer through food chains [food chain efficiency (FCE)] is an important ecosystem function. It has been hypothesized that FCE across multiple trophic levels is constrained by the efficiency at which herbivores use plant energy, which depends on plant nutritional quality. Furthermore, the number of trophic levels may also constrain FCE, because herbivores are less efficient in using plant production when they are constrained by carnivores. These hypotheses have not been tested experimentally in food chains with 3 or more trophic levels. In a field experiment manipulating light, nutrients, and food-chain length, we show that FCE is constrained by algal food quality and food-chain length. FCE across 3 trophic levels (phytoplankton to carnivorous fish) was highest under low light and high nutrients, where algal quality was best as indicated by taxonomic composition and nutrient stoichiometry. In 3-level systems, FCE was constrained by the efficiency at which both herbivores and carnivores converted food into production; a strong nutrient effect on carnivore efficiency suggests a carryover effect of algal quality across 3 trophic levels. Energy transfer efficiency from algae to herbivores was also higher in 2-level systems (without carnivores) than in 3-level systems. Our results support the hypothesis that FCE is strongly constrained by light, nutrients, and food-chain length and suggest that carryover effects across multiple trophic levels are important. Because many environmental perturbations affect light, nutrients, and food-chain length, and many ecological services are mediated by FCE, it will be important to apply these findings to various ecosystem types.},

	abstract = {Untangling Food Webs
The factors affecting the stability of food webs are important in conservation and ecological restoration. Gross et al. (p. 747) used a generalized modeling approach to evaluate billions of replicates of food webs in order to reveal the properties that stabilize (or destabilize) food webs. Variability in the strength of trophic links between predator and prey strength affected stability in different ways depending on the size of the web—stabilizing only in relatively small food webs and destabilizing in larger ones. Universal topological rules were extracted for the patterns of network links that enhance food-web stability.
Insights into what stabilizes natural food webs have always been limited by a fundamental dilemma: Studies either need to make unwarranted simplifying assumptions, which undermines their relevance, or only examine few replicates of small food webs, which hampers the robustness of findings. We used generalized modeling to study several billion replicates of food webs with nonlinear interactions and up to 50 species. In this way, first we show that higher variability in link strengths stabilizes food webs only when webs are relatively small, whereas larger webs are instead destabilized. Second, we reveal a new power law describing how food-web stability scales with the number of species and their connectance. Third, we report two universal rules: Food-web stability is enhanced when (i) species at a high trophic level feed on multiple prey species and (ii) species at an intermediate trophic level are fed upon by multiple predator species.
Analysis of several billion replicates of food webs reveals universal topological rules affecting their stability.

	abstract = {In a comparative study covering 11 temperate lake ecosystems of Iow to intermediate productivity, we tested the predictions of the food chain model developed by L. Oksanen et al. The pelagic habitat of the most unproductive lakes lacked secondary carnivores (piscivores), whereas secondary carnivores inhabited the more productive lakes in agreement with the assumption that food chain length is limited by the productivity of the system. The observed relationships between planktivores (primary carnivores), zooplankton (herbivores), and phytoplankton (primary producers) were in agreement with the predictions of the Oksanen et al. model for three- and four-trophic-link systems. Piscivore relationships were significant only when the biomass of piscivorous perch only was used as the independent variable (piscivorous perch amounted to ≥97\% of total piscivore biomass in five out of six four-link systems). The results suggest that gross patterns of food web dynamics in temperate lakes may be collapsed into food chain dynamics. However, as the higher trophic levels of most lakes were dominated by the same two species, an alternative hypothesis is that the simplicity of the food webs studied allowed food chain dynamics to approximate food web dynamics. The food chain model tested gave accurate predictions of trophic-level relationships within the rather narrow productivity range studied. However, previous data suggest that, due to size-structured interactions, secondary carnivores (piscivores) play a minor role in highly productive systems, a circumstance that may explain the postulated increase in mortality rate of zooplankton with increasing productivity. The observed increase in number of trophic levels with productivity does not necessarily imply a causal relationship between productivity and food chain length, as lake productivity is also correlated with structural complexity (in thc form of submerged vegetation and an oxygenated hypollmnion). Habitat heterogeneity may thus influence food chain length, and in general it is likely that food chain length will depend on more than one environmental variable.},

	abstract = {The effects of prey heterogeneity and consumer identity on the strength of predator limitation of prey biomass were explored experimentally under controlled laboratory conditions. In this study, I utilized a model aquatic community composed of zooplankton as top predators, algae as prey, and nutrients as basal resources. To examine the effects of prey heterogeneity, I created a food chain initially composed of a single edible prey and a food web initially composed of a diverse assemblage of algae. These two prey treatments were then fully crossed with two predator treatments (a large-bodied zooplankter, Daphnia pulex, and a small-bodied species, Ceriodaphnia quadrangula), and two levels of productivity. Prey heterogeneity had clear effects on the ability of predators to limit overall prey biomass. In food chains, predators had strong negative effects on algae, and algal biomass exhibited a narrow response to enrichment. In contrast, predator limitation was weak in food webs with the consequence that predator and prey biomass both showed positive increases with productivity. The prey community in food webs also exhibited a striking increase in the relative abundance of large inedible algae with enrichment, in keeping with model predictions. These results indicate that prey heterogeneity can have substantial effects on predator–prey dynamics and trophic structure and can serve to shift systems from strong top-down control to ones in which prey are colimited by predators and resources. Comparisons between top predators showed that Daphnia, compared to Ceriodaphnia, more strongly limited the biomass of large algae in food webs at high productivity and total algal biomass in all nutrient-enriched treatments (both chains and webs). Thus, consumer identity and ecological context (productivity and heterogeneity of prey communities) may mediate the strength of zooplankton–algae interactions and the efficacy of trophic cascades.},

	abstract = {Network approaches to ecological questions have been increasingly used, particularly in recent decades. The abstraction of ecological systems – such as communities – through networks of interactions between their components indeed provides a way to summarize this information with single objects. The methodological framework derived from graph theory also provides numerous approaches and measures to analyze these objects and can offer new perspectives on established ecological theories as well as tools to address new challenges. However, prior to using these methods to test ecological hypotheses, it is necessary that we understand, adapt, and use them in ways that both allow us to deliver their full potential and account for their limitations. Here, we attempt to increase the accessibility of network approaches by providing a review of the tools that have been developed so far, with – what we believe to be – their appropriate uses and potential limitations. This is not an exhaustive review of all methods and metrics, but rather, an overview of tools that are robust, informative, and ecologically sound. After providing a brief presentation of species interaction networks and how to build them in order to summarize ecological information of different types, we then classify methods and metrics by the types of ecological questions that they can be used to answer from global to local scales, including methods for hypothesis testing and future perspectives. Speciﬁcally, we show how the organization of species interactions in a community yields different network structures (e.g., more or less dense, modular or nested), how different measures can be used to describe and quantify these emerging structures, and how to compare communities based on these differences in structures. Within networks, we illustrate metrics that can be used to describe and compare the functional and dynamic roles of species based on their position in the network and the organization of their interactions as well as associated new methods to test the signiﬁcance of these results. Lastly, we describe potential fruitful avenues for new methodological developments to address novel ecological questions.},

Changes in ﬁsh communities can be a major determinant of food web dynamics, and even small shifts in species composition or richness can translate into large effects on ecosystems. In addition, there is a large information gap in extrapolating results of small-scale biodiversity–ecosystem function experiments to natural systems with realistic environmental complexity. Thus, we tested the key mechanisms (resource complementarity and selection effect) for biodiversity to inﬂuence ﬁsh production in mesocosms and ponds. Fish diversity treatments were created by replicating species richness and species composition within each richness level. In mesocosms, increasing richness had a positive effect on ﬁsh biomass with an overyielding pattern indicating species mixtures were more productive than any individual species. Additive partitioning conﬁrmed a positive net effect of biodiversity driven by a complementarity effect. Productivity was less affected by species diversity when species were more similar. Thus, the primary mechanism driving ﬁsh production in the mesocosms was resource complementarity.},

Warming strengthened trophic cascades from ﬁsh to primary producers, and it decreased the impact of eutrophication on the mean and temporal variation of phytoplankton biomass. These impacts varied seasonally, with higher temperatures leading to stronger trophic cascades in winter and weaker algae blooms under eutrophication in summer. Our results suggest that higher temperatures may shift the control of primary production in freshwater ponds toward stronger top-down and weaker bottom-up effects. The dampened temporal variability of algal biomass under eutrophication at higher temperatures suggests that warming may stabilize some ecosystem processes.},

We hypothesized that patterns in the body-size structure of entire lake fish assemblages are primarily temperature driven and consistent with the dominant pattern of the temperature–size rule, which suggests a decrease in adult body size with increasing developmental temperature for many ectothermic species. Location 356 European lakes. Methods Variation in the body-size structure of fish assemblages was explored on a continental scale along gradients of temperature, morphometry, productivity and fish assemblage structure for 356 European lakes. The mean fish assemblage body-size and individual body-size distributions were selected as size metrics. Separate analyses were conducted for lakes located within five ecoregion subsets (Borealic Uplands/Tundra, FennoScandian Shield, Central Plains, Western Plains and Western Highlands) and for lakes with different functional fish classifications (cold-, cool- and warmwater fish assemblages). Results Geographical patterns of variation in the body-size structure of European lake fish assemblages could be clearly discerned along a temperature gradient for both the continental dataset (356 lakes) and the smaller geographical (ecoregion) subsets. We found systematic changes in fish assemblage body-size structure across temperature gradients in correspondence with the dominant thermal fish guild. The majority of the lakes, mainly located in the warmer European lowlands, were dominated by eurythermic cool- and warmwater fish assemblages, with smaller sized individuals characterized by linear individual body-size distributions. Lakes located in colder regions and dominated by stenothermic coldwater salmonids with larger sized individuals were characterized by unimodal or bimodal size distributions. The mean body size of cold-, cool- and warmwater fish assemblages changed uniformly along the temperature gradient. Main conclusions Patterns of variation in the body-size structure of European lake fish assemblages are consistent with the temperature–size rule. Temperature modifies fish assemblage size structure uniformly within the thermal fish guilds and in different ecoregions. Furthermore, our results indicate an increasing predictive power of temperature to explain variability in body-size structure when moving from warmer to colder geographical regions.},

Ecologists have investigated both the influence of environmental variables on species diversity and the influence of species diversity on ecosystem function and stability. These investigations have largely been carried out without taking into account the overarching stabilizing structures of food webs that arise from evolutionary and successional processes and that are maintained through species interactions. Here, we argue that the same large-scale structures that have been purported to convey stability to food webs can also help to understand both the distribution of species diversity in nature and the relationship between species diversity and food web stability. Specifically, the allocation of species diversity to slow energy channels within food webs results in the skewed distribution of interactions strengths that has been shown to confer stability to complex food webs. We end by discussing the processes that might generate and maintain the structured, stable and diverse food webs observed in nature.},

	abstract = {Organism size is one of the key determinants of community structure, and its relationship with abundance can describe how biomass is partitioned among the biota within an ecosystem. An outdoor freshwater mesocosm experiment was used to determine how warming of∼4 °C would affect the size, biomass and taxonomic structure of planktonic communities. Warming increased the steepness of the community size spectrum by increasing the prevalence of small organisms, primarily within the phytoplankton assemblage and it also reduced the mean and maximum size of phytoplankton by approximately one order of magnitude. The observed shifts in phytoplankton size structure were reflected in changes in phytoplankton community composition, though zooplankton taxonomic composition was unaffected by warming. Furthermore, warming reduced community biomass and total phytoplankton biomass, although zooplankton biomass was unaffected. This resulted in an increase in the zooplankton to phytoplankton biomass ratio in the warmed mesocosms, which could be explained by faster turnover within the phytoplankton assemblages. Overall, warming shifted the distribution of phytoplankton size towards smaller individuals with rapid turnover and low standing biomass, resulting in a reorganization of the biomass structure of the food webs. These results indicate future environmental warming may have profound effects on the structure and functioning of aquatic communities and ecosystems.},

	abstract = {Food-chain length (FCL) in ecosystems has been studied extensively, and numerous hypotheses to predict FCL, productivity, ecosystem size, and productive space have been proposed. For example, the productivity hypothesis suggests that resource availability limits FCL, whereas the productive-space hypothesis predicts that per-unit-size resource availability and ecosystem size equally limit FCL. However, previous studies have only measured total productivity to test FCL and have never tested the impact of resource availability within a system on FCL. Therefore, we estimated FCL in 15 ponds using stable isotope techniques to test the most common hypotheses for predicting FCL. We also measured total productivity, pond volume (ecosystem size), and edible microalgal carbon (resource availability) in each pond. We found that productive-space (edible carbon+pond volume) was the best model to predict FCL, and FCL was significantly correlated with edible carbon and pond volume. However, factors such as total productivity did not directly predict FCL of the ponds. Therefore, our results suggest that both resource availability and ecosystem size predict FCL in pond ecosystems and play significant roles in maintaining longer FCLs. Furthermore, the productive-space hypothesis appears to be particularly important for determining the FCL of ponds.},

The productivity and productive-space hypotheses propose that food-chain length should increase with increasing resource availability; however, the productivity hypothesis does not include ecosystem size as a determinant of resource availability. The ecosystem-size hypothesis is based on the relationship between ecosystem size and species diversity, habitat availability and habitat heterogeneity14,15. We find that food-chain length increases with ecosystem size, but that the length of the food chain is not related to productivity. Our results support the hypothesis that ecosystem size, and not resource availability, determines food-chain length in these natural ecosystems.},

Our theoretical analysis shows that coupled fast and slow channels convey both local and non-local stability to food webs. Alarmingly, the same human actions that have been implicated in the loss of biodiversity also directly erode the very structures and processes that we show to confer stability on food webs.},

Understanding how complex interaction networks will be reorganized under climate change represents a major challenge in the fields of ecology and biogeography. However, forecasting the potential effects of climate change on local communities, and more particularly on food-web structure, requires the consideration of highly structuring processes, such as trophic interactions. A major breakthrough is therefore expected by combining predictive models integrating habitat selection processes, the physiological limits of marine species and their trophic interactions. In this study, we forecasted the potential impacts of climate change on the local food-web structure of the highly threatened Gulf of Gabes ecosystem located in the south of the Mediterranean Sea. We coupled the climatic envelope and habitat models to an allometric niche food web model, hence taking into account the different processes acting at regional (climate) and local scales (habitat selection and trophic interactions). Our projections under the A2 climate change scenario showed that future food webs would be composed of smaller species with fewer links, resulting in a decrease of connectance, generality, vulnerability and mean trophic level of communities and an increase of the average path length, which may have large consequences on ecosystem functioning. The unified framework presented here, by connecting food-web ecology, biogeography and seascape ecology, allows the exploration of spatial aspects of interspecific interactions under climate change and improves our current understanding of climate change impacts on local marine food webs.},

	abstract = {Understanding the factors that constrain and drive changes in food chain length represents an open challenge in ecology. Although several explanatory hypotheses have been proposed, no synthesis has yet been achieved. The role of body size has been well-studied in recent years because the hierarchy of trophic connections – in which large animals consume small ones – suggests a positive relationship between trophic position and body size. Empirical evidence, however, supports the existence of both positive and negative associations, and some studies have even reported no significant relationship between trophic position and body size. These results suggest that the relationship may be non-monotonic and driven by several interacting mechanisms. Here, we analyze the effects of energetic limitations and structural constraints on species’ trophic positions. We show that the trophic position of small-bodied animals can be limited by their ability to consume large prey, whereas energetic limitations strongly constrain trophic positions for large-bodied animals, with the intensity of this constraint depending on the amount of energy available to top predators. These differences in limiting mechanisms can account for the observed variability in the association between the trophic position of top predators and size. Furthermore, our derivation makes use of the Metabolic theory of ecology and predicts a negative relationship between temperature and the maximum achievable food chain length, providing a mechanistic foundation for the observed reductions in food chain length with temperature.},

	abstract = {In ectothermic organisms, it is hypothesized that metabolic rates mediate influences of temperature on the ecological and evolutionary processes governing biodiversity. However, it is unclear how and to what extent the influence of temperature on metabolism scales up to shape large-scale diversity patterns. In order to clarify the roles of temperature and metabolism, new theory is needed. Here, we establish such theory and model eco-evolutionary dynamics of trophic networks along a broad temperature gradient. In the model temperature can influence, via metabolism, resource supply, consumers' vital rates and mutation rate. Mutation causes heritable variation in consumer body size, which diversifies and governs consumer function in the ecological network. The model predicts diversity to increase with temperature if resource supply is temperature-dependent, whereas temperature-dependent consumer vital rates cause diversity to decrease with increasing temperature. When combining both thermal dependencies, a unimodal temperature–diversity pattern evolves, which is reinforced by temperature-dependent mutation rate. Studying coexistence criteria for two consumers showed that these outcomes are owing to temperature effects on mutual invasibility and facilitation. Our theory shows how and why metabolism can influence diversity, generates predictions useful for understanding biodiversity gradients and represents an extendable framework that could include factors such as colonization history and niche conservatism.},

	abstract = {Two competing consumer species may coexist using a single homogeneous resource when the more efficient consumer—the one having the lowest equilibrium resource density—has a more nonlinear functional response that generates consumer‐resource cycles. We extend this model of nonequilibrium coexistence, as proposed by Armstrong and McGehee, by putting the interaction into a spatial context using two frameworks: a spatially explicit individual‐based model and a spatially implicit metapopulation model. We find that Armstrong and McGehee’s mechanism of coexistence can operate in a spatial context. However, individual‐based simulations suggest that decreased dispersal restricts coexistence in most cases, whereas differential equation models of metapopulations suggest that a low rate of dispersal between subpopulations often increases the coexistence region. This difference arises in part because of two potentially opposing effects on coexistence due to the asynchrony in the temporal dynamics at different locations. Asynchrony implies that the less efficient species is more likely to be favored in some spatial locations at any given time, which broadens the conditions for coexistence. On the other hand, asynchrony and dispersal can also reduce the amplitude of local population cycles, which restricts coexistence. The relative influence of these two effects depends on details of the population dynamics and the representation of space. Our results also demonstrate that coexistence via the Armstrong‐McGehee mechanism can occur even when there is little variation in the global densities of either the consumers or the resource, suggesting that empirical studies of the mechanisms should measure densities on several spatial scales.},

Yet research on character displacement is biased, as it has focused almost exclusively on pairs of interacting species while ignoring multispecies interactions. Communities are seldom so simple that only pairs of species interact, and it is not clear whether inferences from pairwise interactions are sufficient to explain patterns of phenotypes in nature. Here, we test for character displacement in a natural system of freshwater fishes in western Mexico that contains up to four congeneric species of the genus Poeciliopsis. We analyzed body shape differences between populations with different numbers of competitors while accounting for confounding environmental variables. Surprisingly, we found evidence for convergent character displacement in populations of P. prolifica, P. viriosa, and P. latidens. We also found that the convergence in body shape was not consistently in the same direction, meaning that when three or more competitors co-occurred, we did not find more extreme body shapes compared with when there were only two competitors. Instead, when three or more competitors co-occurred, body shape was intermediate between the shape found with a pair of species and the shape found with no competitor present. This intermediate shape suggests that evolution in multispecies communities likely occurs in response to several competitors rather than to simple pairwise interactions. Overall, our results suggest that competition among multiple species is more complex than simple pairwise competitive interactions.},

	abstract = {We study spatial lottery models of competition between two plant species in which competitive ability is affected by levels of herbivory. Herbivory may enhance plant diversity in two qualitatively different ways. The first is global frequency dependence; the level of herbivory suffered by a plant decreases as the species becomes rare. Second, spatial variability in levels of herbivory can create ephemeral, local refuges for herbivory for each plant species. Both of these mechanisms operate only if there is not a negative correlation between a plant's palatability and its competitive ability. Both mechanisms also require that herbivores have sufficiently strong diet preferences (or, equivalently, that the plants have sufficiently different grazing tolerances). If there is no relationship between palatability and competitive ability, then plant diversity is a monotonically increasing function of the herbivore's degree of monophagy. In contrast, if there is a positive correlation between palatability and competitive ability, then the diversity/degree-of-monophagy relationship may be either monotonically increasing or humped.},

The competitiveness of species is hierarchically ordered and the dynamics of the model are described by spatially local interactions of individuals. The size of the local neighborhood may depend on the species. The habitat consists of inhabitable and permanently destroyed sites. It was previously observed (Nee \& May, 1992; Tilmanet al., 1994, 1997) that destruction of habitat may aid the inferior species and cause the superior species to go extinct. These conclusions were based on ann-species model in which the spatial arrangement of destroyed sites was ignored. We examine the effects of different spatial arrangements of destroyed sites on survival and coexistence of the two species. We conclude that the spatial arrangement plays an important role and can influence the outcome qualitatively. The key quantity for predicting the outcome of habitat destruction on species survival is the relationship between the mean dispersal distance and the mean distance between inhabitable and destroyed sites. We contrast the hierarchical model with a version of the Lotka–Volterra model of interspecific competition and show that habitat destruction can alter the dominance relationship between species by reducing intraspecific competition.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT Knowledge of species composition and their interactions, in the form of interaction networks, is required to understand processes shaping their distribution over time and space. As such, comparing ecological networks along environmental gradients represents a promising new research avenue to understand the organization of life. Variation in the position and intensity of links within networks along environmental gradients may be driven by turnover in species composition, by variation in species abundances and by abiotic influences on species interactions. While investigating changes in species composition has a long tradition, so far only a limited number of studies have examined changes in species interactions between networks, often with differing approaches. Here, we review studies investigating variation in network structures along environmental gradients, highlighting how methodological decisions about standardization can influence their conclusions. Due to their complexity, variation among ecological networks is frequently studied using properties that summarize the distribution or topology of interactions such as number of links, connectance, or modularity. These properties can either be compared directly or using a procedure of standardization. While measures of network structure can be directly related to changes along environmental gradients, standardization is frequently used to facilitate interpretation of variation in network properties by controlling for some co-variables, or via null models. Null models allow comparing the deviation of empirical networks from random expectations and are expected to provide a more mechanistic understanding of the factors shaping ecological networks when they are coupled with functional traits. As an illustration, we compare approaches to quantify the role of trait matching in driving the structure of plant?hummingbird mutualistic networks, i.e. a direct comparison, standardized by null models and hypothesis-based metaweb. Overall, our analysis warns against a comparison of studies that rely on distinct forms of standardization, as they are likely to highlight different signals. Fostering a better understanding of the analytical tools available and the signal they detect will help produce deeper insights into how and why ecological networks vary along environmental gradients.},

Our understanding of their expected shape relies on the assumption of invariant steady-state conditions. However, most of the world’s ecosystems experience disturbances that keep them far from such a steady state. Here, using the allometric scaling between population growth rate and body-size, we predict the response of size-abundance pyramids within a trophic guild to any combination of disturbance frequency and intensity affecting all species in a similar way. We show that disturbances narrow the base of size-abundance pyramids, lower their height and decrease total community biomass in a nonlinear way. An experimental test using microbial communities demonstrates that the model captures well the effect of disturbances on empirical pyramids. Overall, we demonstrate both theoretically and experimentally how disturbances that are not size-selective can nonetheless have disproportionate impacts on large species.},

We found no relationship between species richness and biomass under constant conditions. However, when communities were exposed to experimental drought, biomass increased with species richness. Responses of individual species demonstrated that facilitative interactions rather than sampling effects or niche complementarity best explained results—survivorship increased for almost all species, and those species least resistant to drought in monoculture had the greatest increase in biomass. Positive interactions may be an important but previously underemphasized mechanism linking high diversity to high productivity under stressful environmental conditions.},

	abstract = {Aim Spatial dynamics and habitat connectivity affect community composition and diversity in many ecosystems. For many decades, diversity patterns in riverine ecosystems were thought to be related to local environmental conditions. Recent theoretical work, however, suggests that diversity in rivers is strongly affected by dispersal along the dendritic landscape structure and that environmental conditions are intrinsically linked to the network position. In this study we tested hypotheses on network position by relating river network geometry and connectivity to multi-level biodiversity patterns across large scales. Location Three major alpine drainage basins in Switzerland were studied (Rhine, Rhone, Ticino), extending over an elevational gradient of {\textgreater} 2500 m and covering a total area of 41,285 km2. Methods We sampled all may-, stone- and caddisfly species at 217 sites which representatively cover the three river networks. Using generalized additive models, we related diversity patterns in aquatic insects to centrality within the network as a direct river network property, and to catchment area and elevation, which are related to network position. Results Centrality within the river network, and catchment area and elevation had significant and interacting effects on α-diversity and community similarity. Alpha diversity was lowest in peripheral headwaters and at high elevations. Species richness generally increased with increasing catchment area. Well-connected, central communities within the river network had greater α-diversity than more peripheral communities did. Elevation was a strong predictor of α-diversity, with the most diverse communities found at mid-elevation sites. Community similarity decreased with increasing along-stream distance between sites. Main conclusions Our results highlight the fact that diversity patterns of aquatic insects in river systems are related to local factors such as elevation, but interact with network properties and connectivity along waterways, and differ among insect orders. These findings are consistent with dispersal-limited processes and indicate that riverine diversity should be addressed and protected taking the river network structure into account.},

We investigate how several extinction orders affect the minimum number of secondary extinctions expected within pelagic food webs from 34 temperate freshwater lakes. An ecologically plausible extinction order is derived from the geographically nested pattern of species composition among the lakes and is corroborated by species' pH tolerances. Simulations suggest that lake communities are remarkably robust to this realistic extinction order and highly sensitive to the reverse sequence of species loss. This sensitivity is not well explained by the known sensitivity of networks to the loss of highly connected species but appears to be better explained by our observation that trophic specialists preferentially consume widely distributed species at low risk of extinction.

In this study, we present a simple model of a linear food chain and systematically evaluate how stability—measured as invariability—changes with the addition or removal of trophic levels. We identify the presence of trophic cascades in the stability of species. Owing to top-down control by predation and bottom-up regulation by prey, we find that stability of a species is highest when it is at the top of the food chain and lowest when it is just under the top of the food chain. Thus, stability shows patterns identical to those of mean biomass with the addition or removal of trophic levels in food chains. Our results provide a baseline towards a general theory of the effect of adding or removing trophic levels on stability, which can be used to inform empirical studies.},

Results: Analysed sites ranged from almost pure subalpine spruce stands to mixed deciduous lowland forests with eight tree species per stand. The above-ground biomass accumulation ranged from 169 to 536 tons of dry mass per hectare. For the analysed data set the relationship between tree species diversity and biomass accumulation was not significant but showed a negative trend.

However, the diversity-productivity relationship in old-growth forests is not well understood.• We quantified biomass and above-ground production in nine forest stands with increasing tree species diversity from monocultures of beech to stands consisting of up to five deciduous tree species (Fagus sylvatica, Fraxinus excelsior, Tilia spp., Carpinus betulus, Acer spp.) to examine (a) if mixed stands are more productive than monospecific stands, (b) how tree species differ in the productivity of stem wood, leaves and fruits, and (c) if beech productivity increases with tree diversity due to lower intraspecific competition and complementary resource use.• Total above-ground biomass and wood production decreased with increasing tree species diversity. In Fagus and Fraxinus, the basal area-related wood productivity exceeded those of the co-occurring tree species, while Tilia had the highest leaf productivity. Fagus trees showed no elevated production per basal area in the mixed stands.• We found no evidence of complementary resource use associated with biomass production. We conclude that above-ground productivity of old-growth temperate deciduous forests depend more on tree species-specific traits than on tree diversity itself.},

We used ground-based laser scanning for analyzing the canopy structure and three-dimensional space filling by foliage and twigs in a species-rich temperate old-growth forest to test the hypotheses that (i) canopy space filling increases with tree species richness, and (ii) a higher degree of canopy space filling in diverse stands is linked to higher aboveground productivity (NPPa). Space filling was quantified in 80 plots with variable species composition (five species) and species richness (1–3 species) and related to stem wood and litter production. Neither space filling nor NPPa were higher in more diverse than monospecific plots, while species identity had a significant effect on the patterns of space occupation in the sun and shade crown. We conclude that increased complementarity in canopy space filling among the species is not an important productivity-determining factor in this temperate mixed forest.},

While positive effects of biodiversity on temporal stability of communities have been demonstrated in theoretical and empirical studies, diversity–stability relationships at the population level remain poorly understood. 2. We investigated temporal variability of plant populations in experimental grassland plots of varying species richness (1, 2, 4, 8, 16–60 species), functional group richness and composition (presence/absence of legumes × grasses × small herbs × tall herbs) in a long-term biodiversity experiment from 2003 to 2009 (‘Jena Experiment’). 3. Average population stability, defined as the reciprocal of the coefficient of variation of above-ground biomass production over time, differed largely between species but was generally higher in grasses and small herbs than in legumes and tall herbs. Furthermore, population stability was positively related to a species’ proportional contribution to community biomass. Thus, an increasing number of subordinate species explained lower average population stabilities at higher diversity levels. 4. A negative covariance (CV) across all species-richness levels suggested negatively correlated species dynamics. Species belonging to different functional groups fluctuated asynchronously, while species dynamics within functional groups were more synchronous. Community-wide species synchrony decreased with increasing species richness, and temporal stability at the community level increased. 5. Synthesis: Our results suggest that diversity–stability relationships are driven by fluctuations in the population biomass of individual species which are less synchronized in more diverse than in less diverse mixtures and monocultures. Dominant plant species tend to be more stabilized than subdominant species, independently of community species richness. However, asynchrony of population dynamics outweighs decreasing population stability with increasing species richness, resulting in higher temporal stability at the plant community level.},

We used experimental species mixtures of grassland plants to test this hypothesis and identified the mechanisms involved. Additionally, we tested whether biodiversity, productivity and temporal stability were similarly influenced by particular types of species interactions. We found that productivity was less variable among years in plots planted with more species. Temporal stability did not depend on whether the species were planted equally abundant (high evenness) or not (realistically low evenness). Greater richness increased temporal stability by increasing overyielding, asynchrony of species fluctuations and statistical averaging. Species interactions that favoured unproductive species increased both biodiversity and temporal stability. Species interactions that resulted in niche partitioning or facilitation increased both productivity and temporal stability.

	abstract = {Warming has profound effects on biological rates such as metabolism, growth, feeding and death of organisms, eventually affecting their ability to survive. Using a nonlinear bioenergetic population-dynamic model that accounts for temperature and body-mass dependencies of biological rates, we analysed the individual and interactive effects of increasing temperature and nutrient enrichment on the dynamics of a three-species food chain. At low temperatures, warming counteracts the destabilizing effects of enrichment by both bottom-up (via the carrying capacity) and top-down (via biological rates) mechanisms. Together with increasing consumer body masses, warming increases the system tolerance to fertilization. Simultaneously, warming increases the risk of starvation for large species in low-fertility systems. This effect can be counteracted by increased fertilization. In combination, therefore, two main drivers of global change and biodiversity loss can have positive and negative effects on food chain stability. Our model incorporates the most recent empirical data and may thus be used as the basis for more complex forecasting models incorporating food-web structure.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Natural ecological communities are diverse, complex and often surprisingly stable, but the mechanisms underlying their stability remain a theoretical enigma. Interactions such as competition and predation presumably structure communities, yet theory predicts that complex communities are only stable when species growth rates are mostly limited by intraspecific self-regulation rather than by interactions with resources, competitors and predators. Current theory, however, only considers the network topology of population-level interactions between species and neglects within-population differences among juvenile and adult individuals. Here, using model simulations, I show that including commonly observed differences in vulnerability to predation and foraging efficiency between juvenile and adult individuals results in up to ten times larger, more complex communities than in simulations without population stage-structure. These diverse communities are stable or fluctuate with limited amplitude, even though in the model only a single basal species is self-regulated and the population-level interaction network is highly connected. Analysis of the species interaction matrix predicts the simulated communities to be unstable but extending the matrix with a population structure subsystem reveals that dynamic changes in population stage-structure completely cancel out this instability. Common differences between juveniles and adults and fluctuations in their relative abundance hence have a decisive influence on the stability of complex natural communities and their vulnerability when environmental conditions change. Thus, community persistence can not be explained by the network of interactions between the constituting species alone.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

In this theme issue, we highlight a novel pathway through which warming indirectly affects ecological communities: by changing their size structure (i.e. the body-size distributions). Warming can shift these distributions towards dominance of small- over large-bodied species. The conceptual, theoretical and empirical research described in this issue, in sum, suggests that effects of temperature may be dominated by changes in size structure, with relatively weak direct effects. For example, temperature effects via size structure have implications for top-down and bottom-up control in ecosystems and may ultimately yield novel communities. Moreover, scaling up effects of temperature and body size from physiology to the levels of populations, communities and ecosystems may provide a crucially important mechanistic approach for forecasting future consequences of global warming.},

We used a dynamic model of complex, size-structured food webs to assess interactive effects on diversity and network structure. We found antagonistic impacts: Warming increases diversity in eutrophic systems and decreases it in oligotrophic systems. These effects interact with the community size structure: Communities of similarly sized species such as parasitoid–host systems are stabilized by warming and destabilized by eutrophication, whereas the diversity of size-structured predator–prey networks decreases strongly with warming, but decreases only weakly with eutrophication. Nonrandom extinction risks for generalists and specialists lead to higher connectance in networks without size structure and lower connectance in size-structured communities. Overall, our results unravel interactive impacts of warming and eutrophication and suggest that size structure may serve as an important proxy for predicting the community sensitivity to these global change stressors.},

Land-use change by humans, particularly forest loss, is influencing Earth's biodiversity through time. To assess the influence of forest loss on population and biodiversity change, Daskalova et al. integrated data from more than 6000 time series of species' abundance, richness, and composition in ecological assemblages around the world. Forest loss leads to both positive and negative responses of populations and biodiversity, and the temporal lags in population and biodiversity change after forest loss can extend up to half a century. Land-use change precipitates divergent population and biodiversity change. This analysis has consequences for projections of human impact, ongoing conservation, and assessments of biodiversity change.
Science, this issue p. 1341
Global biodiversity assessments have highlighted land-use change as a key driver of biodiversity change. However, there is little empirical evidence of how habitat transformations such as forest loss and gain are reshaping biodiversity over time. We quantified how change in forest cover has influenced temporal shifts in populations and ecological assemblages from 6090 globally distributed time series across six taxonomic groups. We found that local-scale increases and decreases in abundance, species richness, and temporal species replacement (turnover) were intensified by as much as 48\% after forest loss. Temporal lags in population- and assemblage-level shifts after forest loss extended up to 50 years and increased with species’ generation time. Our findings that forest loss catalyzes population and biodiversity change emphasize the complex biotic consequences of land-use change.
Declines in forest cover amplify both gains and losses in plant and animal population abundance and diversity over time.

	abstract = {In size-structured predator–prey systems, capture success depends on the sizes of both predator and prey. We study the population-dynamic consequences of size-dependent predation using a model of a size-structured, cannibalistic fish population with one shared, alternative resource. We assume that a prey can be captured by a predator if the ratio of prey length to predator length is within a specific range, referred to as the “predation window.” We find that the lower limit of the predation window (δ) has a major impact on population dynamics, whereas the upper limit (ε) mainly affects population structure and individual life history. For large δ, cannibalism cannot decimate young-of-year (YOY) cohorts. Size-dependent competition then results in recruit-driven, single-cohort cycles. With low δ, cannibalism regulates recruitment, resulting in coexistence of many year classes. With intermediate δ, periods of regulation by cannibalism alternate with periods with severe competition. Occasional high densities of small individuals enable a few cannibals to reach giant sizes, producing a bimodal population size distribution. With small ε, all individuals remain small; the population is stunted. Large piscivores can exist only if induced dynamically in population fluctuations. Above a critical ε, large piscivores are present permanently, even in stable populations. The critical effect of ε relates to the ontogenetic niche shift from planktivory to piscivory. Observed population dynamics of Eurasian perch, yellow perch, and Arctic char, described in the literature, are discussed and, based on our modeling results, can be related to differences in the predation windows of these species. We argue that the effects of δ and ε relate to two fundamentally different and mutually exclusive aspects of cannibalism.},

	abstract = {Biologically derived safe sites appear to strongly affect spatial and temporal patterns in terrestrial plant communities; however, few experimental field studies have been conducted to investigate the importance of such interactions or the mechanisms by which they operate. Quercus douglasii and Quercus lobata are winter—deciduous oaks endemic to California. I examined association between seedlings of these oaks and several species of shrubs and conducted field experiments that tested for facilitative effects of two shrubs, Salvia leucophylla and Artemisia californica, on seedling survival. Naturally occurring Q. douglasii seedlings were relatively common (280 seedlings/ha) and were strongly associated with shrub canopies. In two experimental plantings, 30\% and 55\% of Q. douglasii seedlings that emerged under shrubs survived for {\textgreater}1 yr, whereas no seedlings in the open survived in either experiment. Survival of Q. douglasii where shrubs were removed was similar to survival in the open grassland, indicting that association between shrubs and oak seedlings was not due to share microsite requirements. Q. douglasii survival was not different between the two shrub species. Only three Q. lobata seedlings were found in 26 study plots, although reproductive adults were present. The seedlings were under shrub canopies. However, the survival of Q. lobata was not facilitated by shrub cover or shrub simulation and no other evidence was found for nurse—shrub interactions with this oak species. Artificial shade was critical to the survival of Q. douglasii seedlings in simulated shrub environments. When grown in artificial shade, photosynthetic capacities and root elongation rates of Q. douglasii seedlings were significantly higher than those of Q. lobata. These differences may partially explain why nurse—plant interactions exist between shrubs and Q. douglasii seedling mortality differed between the shrub and open grassland habitats. Under shrubs, acorn predation was the primary cause of mortality, whereas mortality due to shoot herbivory was much more frequent in the open grassland. Thus, propagules under shrubs that avoided predation until shoot emergence benefitted from canopy shade and protection from herbivores. The shade tolerance and nurse—plant utilization of Q. douglasii seedlings have parallels with shade tolerance and late successional roles of other oak species in temperature deciduous forests, and, as in these forests, may affect the long—term spatial dynamics in California woodlands.},

	abstract = {The feasibility domain of an ecological community can be described by the set of environmental abiotic and biotic conditions under which all co-occurring and interacting species in a given site and time can have positive abundances. Mathematically, the feasibility domain corresponds to the parameter space compatible with positive (feasible) solutions at equilibrium for all the state variables in a system under a given model of population dynamics. Under specific dynamics, the existence of a feasible equilibrium is a necessary condition for species persistence regardless of whether the feasible equilibrium is dynamically stable or not. Thus, the size of the feasibility domain can also be used as an indicator of the tolerance of a community to random environmental variations. This has motivated a rich research agenda to estimate the feasibility domain of ecological communities. However, these methodologies typically assume that species interactions are static, or that input and output energy flows on each trophic level are unconstrained. Yet, this is different to how communities behave in nature. Here, we present a step-by-step quantitative guideline providing illustrative examples, computational code, and mathematical proofs to study systematically the feasibility domain of ecological communities under changes of interspecific interactions and subject to different constraints on the trophic energy flows. This guideline covers multi-trophic communities that can be formed by any type of interspecific interactions. Importantly, we show that the relative size of the feasibility domain can significantly change as a function of the biological information taken into consideration. We believe that the availability of these methods can allow us to increase our understanding about the limits at which ecological communities may no longer tolerate further environmental perturbations, and can facilitate a stronger integration of theoretical and empirical research.},

	abstract = {Ecologists have found many patterns in food-web structure. Some, like the constant connectance hypothesis, lack definitive explanatory mechanisms. In response, we investigated whether community assembly mechanisms could explain why trophic complexity consistently scales with species richness among ecosystems. We analyzed how food-web structure developed during the community assembly recorded in Simberloff and Wilson's classic biogeography experiment. Using their arthropod surveys, we constructed six time series of food-webs from pre- and post-defaunation censuses of six experimental islands, and synthesized trophic information for 250 species from the literature and expert sources. We found that the fraction of specialist species increased and the fraction of generalists decreased during food-web assembly. Directed connectance initially declined over time, despite an increase in species richness, but eventually leveled off as predicted by the constant connectance hypothesis of diversity-complexity scaling. The initial decline was explained by later colonization by trophic specialists, probably due to limited resource availability during early colonization. Late-colonizing super-generalists maintained constant connectance at later dates. This relationship between colonization success and trophic breadth helps explain food-web patterns and corroborates assertions that community assembly is systematically influenced by species’ trophic breadths.},

Enrichment can theoretically destabilize communities but effects may become weaker with increasing diversity because of the inclusion of consumer-resistant prey. Few experiments using direct manipulations of species diversity have tested these predictions. We used laboratory-based aquatic food webs to examine the effects of species composition, diversity and enrichment on temporal variability of population- and community-level biomass. We found weak effects of enrichment on population- and community-level stability. However, diversity enhanced community-level stability while species composition had no influence. In contrast, composition effects outweighed diversity effects when stability was measured at the population level. We found no negative effects of diversity on population-level stability, in opposition to theory. Our results indicate that diversity can enhance stability in multitrophic systems, but effects vary with the scale of biological organization at which stability is measured.},

Machine learning and correlational methods are increasingly popular for inferring networks from co-occurrence and time series data, particularly in microbial systems. In this study, we test the suitability of these methods for inferring ecological interactions by constructing networks using Dynamic Bayesian Networks, Lasso regression, and Pear-son’s correlation coefficient, then comparing the model networks to empirical trophic and nontrophic webs in two ecological systems. We find that although each model significantly replicates the structure of at least one empirical network, no model significantly predicts network structure in both systems, and no model is clearly superior to the others. We also find that networks inferred for the Tatoosh intertidal match the nontrophic network much more closely than the trophic one, possibly due to the challenges of identifying trophic interactions from presence-absence data. Our findings suggest that although these methods hold some promise for ecological network inference, presence-absence data does not provide enough signal for models to consistently identify interactions, and networks inferred from these data should be interpreted with caution.},

	abstract = {Species may indirectly affect populations of other species in two basic ways. Interaction chains result from linked direct interactions between species pairs. Interaction modifications, emergent effects of a multispecies assemblage, result when a third species changes how a pair of other species interacts. Experiments and patterns of abundance in the upper zone of a rocky intertidal community provide examples of both types of indirect effects. By consuming limpets (Lottia digitalis), bird predators indirectly enhance acorn barnacle (Balanus glandula) abundance on horizontal rock benches because limpets dislodge or inadvertently consume young acorn barnacles, an example of an interaction chain. Because L. digitalis has a light-colored shell that is similar in color to barnacle shells, barnacles alter the bird-limpet interaction by changing the ability of birds to find limpets, an example of an interaction modification. Distinguishing between interaction chains and interaction modifications is important because interaction chains can be predicted with only a knowledge of pairwise species interactions while descriptions of interaction modifications require a knowledge of all species combinations involved, precluding a priori prediction. By classifying empirically determined indirect effects, the degree to which indirect effects can be predicted from a knowledge of pairwise interactions can be determined, and the mechanisms that cause interaction modifications can be identified to aid in future prediction.},

	abstract = {At the intersection of consumer behaviour and plant competition is the concept of refuge-mediated apparent competition: an indirect interaction whereby plants provide a refuge for a shared consumer, subsequently increasing consumer pressure on another plant species. Here, we use a simple model and empirical examples to develop and illustrate the concept of refuge-mediated apparent competition. We find that the likelihood that an inferior competitor will succeed via refuge-mediated apparent competition is greater when competitors have similar resource requirements and when consumers exhibit a strong response to the refuge and high attack rates on the superior competitor. Refuge-mediated apparent competition may create an emergent Allee effect, such that a species invades only if it is sufficiently abundant to alter consumer impact on resident species. This indirect interaction may help explain unresolved patterns observed in biological invasion, such as the different physical structure of invasive exotic plants, the lag phase, and the failure of restoration efforts. Given the ubiquity of refuge-seeking behaviour by consumers and the ability of consumers to alter the outcome of direct competition among plants, refuge-mediated apparent competition may be an underappreciated mechanism affecting the composition and diversity of plant communities.

It is shown that thenormal varimax solution probably coincides closely to the application of the principle of simple structure. However, it is proposed that the ultimate criterion of a rotational procedure is factorial invariance, not simple structure—although the two notions appear to be highly related. The normal varimax criterion is shown to be a two-dimensional generalization of the classic Spearman case, i.e., it shows perfect factorial invariance for two pure clusters. An example is given of the invariance of a normal varimax solution for more than two factors. The oblique normal varimax criterion is stated.

	abstract = {Question Positive interactions between plants have well-known effects on community species richness and biomass via micro-environment improvements. However, the effects of indirect facilitation performed by a nurse on an associated plant community, occurring e.g., through protection against grazing, have not attracted much attention in the literature so far, in particular regarding the functional traits of the associated plant communities. Because characteristics of trait distributions can reveal selective pressures at play, they offer valuable information for the study of grazing pressure. Here, we tested the extent to which indirect facilitation affects the amount of distinct trait combinations (H1), trait dominance (H2) and niche differentiation between species (H3) of associated plant communities living under nurse plants. Location Tropical alpine peatlands, Cordillera Real, Bolivia. Methods We set up a grazing exclusion experiment over two dominant nurse cushion species: one providing indirect facilitation under grazing pressure and the other not. We measured three functional traits in the associated communities, which are known to vary depending on the grazing level: LDMC, leaf thickness and maximum height. We assessed the amount of distinct trait combinations by computing the volume of the phenotypic space (H1). The variation in trait dominance was quantified with kurtosis and skewness of the trait distributions (H2). The variation in niche differentiation was evaluated using mean intra-population trait variance relative to intra-community trait variance (H3). Results We did not find a significant effect of grazing and indirect facilitation on the volume of the phenotypic space (H1). However, our study revealed a significant effect of indirect facilitation on dominance in the associated communities by maintaining the evenness of the trait distributions (maximum height and leaf thickness) in grazed compared to ungrazed plots (H2), and on niche differentiation by maintaining trait overlaps (LDMC and maximum height) between species in grazed compared to ungrazed contexts (H3). Conclusion Our results suggest that indirect facilitation promotes the co-existence of contrasting functional strategies (H2) and species niches (H3) in associated plant communities subject to grazing. These results reflect the buffering effect of indirect facilitation on the grazing selective pressures exerted on associated plant communities living under the protection of nurses.},

	abstract = {Biotic interactions are often ignored in assessments of climate change impacts. However, climate-related changes in species interactions, often mediated through increased dominance of certain species or functional groups, may have important implications for how species respond to climate warming and altered precipitation patterns. We examined how a dominant plant functional group affected the population dynamics of four co-occurring forb species by experimentally removing graminoids in seminatural grasslands. Specifically, we explored how the interaction between dominants and subordinates varied with climate by replicating the removal experiment across a climate grid consisting of 12 field sites spanning broad-scale temperature and precipitation gradients in southern Norway. Biotic interactions affected population growth rates of all study species, and the net outcome of interactions between dominants and subordinates switched from facilitation to competition with increasing temperature along the temperature gradient. The impacts of competitive interactions on subordinates in the warmer sites could primarily be attributed to reduced plant survival. Whereas the response to dominant removal varied with temperature, there was no overall effect of precipitation on the balance between competition and facilitation. Our findings suggest that global warming may increase the relative importance of competitive interactions in seminatural grasslands across a wide range of precipitation levels, thereby favouring highly competitive dominant species over subordinate species. As a result, seminatural grasslands may become increasingly dependent on disturbance (i.e. traditional management such as grazing and mowing) to maintain viable populations of subordinate species and thereby biodiversity under future climates. Our study highlights the importance of population-level studies replicated under different climatic conditions for understanding the underlying mechanisms of climate change impacts on plants.},

	abstract = {How the complexity of food webs relates to stability has been a subject of many studies. Often, unweighted connectance is used to express complexity. Unweighted connectance is measured as the proportion of realized links in the network. Weighted connectance, on the other hand, takes link weights (fluxes or feeding rates) into account and captures the shape of the flux distribution. Here, we used weighted connectance to revisit the relation between complexity and stability. We used 15 real soil food webs and determined the feeding rates and the interaction strength matrices. We calculated both versions of connectance, and related these structural properties to food web stability. We also determined the skewness of both flux and interaction strength distributions with the Gini coefficient. We found no relation between unweighted connectance and food web stability, but weighted connectance was positively correlated with stability. This finding challenges the notion that complexity may constrain stability, and supports the ‘complexity begets stability’ notion. The positive correlation between weighted connectance and stability implies that the more evenly flux rates were distributed over links, the more stable the webs were. This was confirmed by the Gini coefficients of both fluxes and interaction strengths. However, the most even distributions of this dataset still were strongly skewed towards small fluxes or weak interaction strengths. Thus, incorporating these distribution with many weak links via weighted instead of unweighted food web measures can shed new light on classical theories.},

Variation in the way interactions are organized among species results in different network structures, which translates into a community's ability to resist collapse and change. To better understand the factors involved in dictating ongoing dynamics in a community at a given time, we must unravel how interactions affect the assembly process. Here, we build a novel, integrative conceptual model for understanding how ecological communities assemble that combines ecological networks and island biogeography theory, as well as the principles of niche theory. Through our conceptual model, we show how the rate of species turnover and gene flow within communities will influence the structure of ecological networks. We conduct a preliminary test of our predictions using plant-herbivore networks from differently-aged sites in the Hawaiian archipelago. Our approach will allow future modeling and empirical studies to develop a better understanding of the role of the assembly process in shaping patterns of biodiversity.},

	abstract = {The analysis of environmental DNA (eDNA) allows eﬃcient surveys of freshwater species and is being increasingly used. However, most studies generally have a limited sampling plan. Because diﬀerent methods are used by diﬀerent authors, all the data produced with eDNA cannot be easily pooled together for a global overview. Nevertheless, one of the promising perspectives is the standardization of the methods and protocols, for long-term monitoring, early detection of invasive species, and rare species detection. We here present the biggest dataset using eDNA metabarcoding with standardized methods for freshwater bivalves. Sampling was performed mainly in France, with over 350 localities spread over all major basins. Metabarcoding was performed using two new sets of primers, one for the Unionida and one for the Venerida. The species distributions inferred from eDNA sampling are then compared with those currently known. Results give an insight into the valuable data that eDNA analysis can provide if used at a large scale. Some species were found outside of their known range, especially invasive species but also species of conservation interest. Others were found in a surprisingly low number of localities, although currently considered widespread and of no conservation interest. This can be explained by the databases currently used to establish conservation status, which are often biased by including ancient data, shell-only data, and potentially misidentiﬁed species. The present study shows that our eDNA metabarcoding approach will be an essential tool to unveil the true species distributions, to better evaluate their status and improve conservation policymaking.},

Here, we assessed the degree of fragmentation of the occurrence ranges of ∼10,000 lotic fish species worldwide due to ∼40,000 existing large dams and ∼3,700 additional future large hydropower dams. Per river basin, we quantified a connectivity index (CI) for each fish species by combining its occurrence range with a high-resolution hydrography and the locations of the dams. Ranges of nondiadromous fish species were more fragmented (less connected) (CI = 73 ± 28\%; mean ± SD) than ranges of diadromous species (CI = 86 ± 19\%). Current levels of fragmentation were highest in the United States, Europe, South Africa, India, and China. Increases in fragmentation due to future dams were especially high in the tropics, with declines in CI of ∼20 to 40 percentage points on average across the species in the Amazon, Niger, Congo, Salween, and Mekong basins. Our assessment can guide river management at multiple scales and in various domains, including strategic hydropower planning, identification of species and basins at risk, and prioritization of restoration measures, such as dam removal and construction of fish bypasses.},

Dark, anoxic conditions under thick floating-plant cover leave little opportunity for animal or plant life, and they can have large negative impacts on fisheries and navigation in tropical lakes. Here, we demonstrate that floating-plant dominance can be a self-stabilizing ecosystem state, which may explain its notorious persistence in many situations. Our results, based on experiments, field data, and models, represent evidence for alternative domains of attraction in ecosystems. An implication of our findings is that nutrient enrichment reduces the resilience of freshwater systems against a shift to floating-plant dominance. On the other hand, our results also suggest that a single drastic harvest of floating plants can induce a permanent shift to an alternative state dominated by rooted, submerged growth forms.},

We examine the effect of food web topologies with equivalent energetics (i.e., trophic interactions are equivalent at each trophic level), following which we vary energetic flows to include weak and strong interactions or nonequivalent energetics. In contrast to some work (Pimm 1979), we find that compartmented webs are more stable than reticulate webs. However, we find that nonequivalent energetics can stabilize previously unstable reticulate structures. It is not only weak flows that can be stabilizing but also the arrangement of the flows that emphasizes stabilizing mechanisms. We find that the main stabilizing mechanism is asynchrony, where structures and energetic arrangements that decrease synchrony such as internal segregation or competition will stabilize dynamics. Since compartments allow prey dynamics to behave somewhat independently, compartmentation readily promotes stability. In addition, these results can be scaled from simple food webs to more complex webs with many interacting subsystems so that linking weak subsystems to strong ones can stabilize dynamics. We show that food web dynamics are determined not only by topology but also the arrangement of weak and strong energetic flows.},

To date, empirical evidence to support this theoretical notion as a systemic aspect of the global economy is largely lacking. Through environmentally-extended multi-regional input-output modelling, we provide empirical evidence for ecologically unequal exchange as a persistent feature of the global economy from 1990 to 2015. We identify the regions of origin and final consumption for four resource groups: materials, energy, land, and labor. By comparing the monetary exchange value of resources embodied in trade, we find significant international disparities in how resource provision is compensated. Value added per ton of raw material embodied in exports is 11 times higher in high-income countries than in those with the lowest income, and 28 times higher per unit of embodied labor. With the exception of embodied land for China and India, all other world regions serve as net exporters of all types of embodied resources to high-income countries across the 1990–2015 time period. On aggregate, ecologically unequal exchange allows high-income countries to simultaneously appropriate resources and to generate a monetary surplus through international trade. This has far-reaching implications for global sustainability and for the economic growth prospects of nations.},

	abstract = {Under equilibrium conditions, previous theory has shown that the presence of omnivory destabilizes food webs. Correspondingly, omnivory ought to be rare in real food webs. Although early food-web data appeared to verify this, recently many ecologists have found omnivory to be ubiquitous in foodweb data gathered at a high taxonomic resolution. In this paper, we reinvestigate the role of omnivory in food webs using a non-equilibrium perspective. We ﬁnd that the addition of omnivory to a simple food-chain model (thus a simple food web) locally stabilizes the food web in a very complete way. First, non-equilibrium dynamics (e.g. chaos) tend to be eliminated or bounded further away from zero, via period-doubling reversals invoked by the omnivorous trophic link. Second, food chains without interior attractors tend to gain a stable interior attractor with moderate amounts of omnivory.},

	abstract = {Classic local stability theory predicts that complex ecological networks are unstable and are unlikely to persist despite empiricists’ abundant documentation of such complexity in nature. This contradiction has puzzled biologists for decades. While some have explored how stability may be achieved in small modules of a few interacting species, rigorous demonstrations of how large complex and ecologically realistic networks dynamically persist remain scarce and inadequately understood. Here, we help fill this void by combining structural models of complex food webs with nonlinear bioenergetic models of population dynamics parameterized by biological rates that are allometrically scaled to populations’ average body masses. Increasing predator–prey body mass ratios increase population persistence up to a saturation level that is reached by invertebrate and ectotherm vertebrate predators when being 10 or 100 times larger than their prey respectively. These values are corroborated by empirical predator–prey body mass ratios from a global data base. Moreover, negative effects of diversity (i.e. species richness) on stability (i.e. population persistence) become neutral or positive relationships at these empirical ratios. These results demonstrate that the predator–prey body mass ratios found in nature may be key to enabling persistence of populations in complex food webs and stabilizing the diversity of natural ecosystems.},

	abstract = {To understand how diversity is distributed in space is a fundamental aim for optimizing future species and community conservation. We examined in parallel species richness and beta diversity components of nine taxonomic groups along a finite space, represented by pastured grasslands along an elevational gradient. Beta diversity, which is assumed to bridge local alpha diversity to regional gamma diversity was partitioned into the two components turnover and nestedness and analyzed at two levels: from the lowest elevation to all other elevations, and between neighboring elevations. Species richness of vascular plants, butterflies, beetles, spiders and earthworms showed a hump-shaped relationship with increasing elevation, while it decreased linearly for grasshoppers and ants, but increased for lichens and bryophytes. For most of the groups, turnover increased with increasing elevational distance along the gradient while nestedness decreased. With regard to step-wise beta diversity, rates of turnover or nestedness did not change notably between neighboring steps for the majority of groups. Our results support the assumption that species communities occupying the same habitat significantly change along elevation, however transition seems to happen continuously and is not detectable between neighboring steps. Our findings, rather than delineating levels of major diversity losses, indicate that conservation actions targeting at a preventive protection for species and their environment in mountainous regions require the consideration of entire spatial settings.},

We have surveyed the species diversity at 192 vegetation sites across different steppe zones in Inner Mongolia, China. We analysed the total species diversity (γ diversity) and its composition (α diversity and β diversity) of different steppe types, and their changes along a precipitation gradient. Our results showed that (i) β diversity contributed more than α diversity to the total (γ) diversity in the Inner Mongolia grassland; the contribution of β diversity increased with precipitation, thus the species-rich (meadow steppe) grassland had greater contribution of β diversity than species-poor (desert steppe) grassland. (ii) All α, β and γ species diversity increased significantly (P{\textless}0.05) with precipitation, but their sensitivity to precipitation (diversity change per mm precipitation increase) was different between the steppe types. The sensitivity of α diversity of different steppe community types was negatively (P{\textless}0.05) correlated with mean annual precipitation, whereas the sensitivity of β and γ diversity showed no trend along the precipitation gradient (P{\textgreater}0.10). (iii) The α diversity increased logarithmically, while β diversity increased exponentially, with γ diversity. Our results suggest that for local species diversity patterns, the site species pool is more important in lower precipitation areas, while local ecological processes are more important in high precipitation areas. In addition, for β diversity maintenance niche processes and diffusion processes are more important in low and high precipitation areas, respectively. Our results imply that a policy of “multiple small reserves” is better than one of a “single large reserve” for conserving species diversity of a steppe ecosystem, and indicate an urgent need to develop management strategies for climate-sensitive desert steppe ecosystem.},

	abstract = {Fungi play a key role in soil–plant interactions, nutrient cycling and carbon flow and are essential for the functioning of arctic terrestrial ecosystems. Some studies have shown that the composition of fungal communities is highly sensitive to variations in environmental conditions, but little is known about how the conditions control the role of fungal communities (i.e., their ecosystem function). We used DNA metabarcoding to compare taxonomic and functional composition of fungal communities along a gradient of environmental severity in Northeast Greenland. We analysed soil samples from fell fields, heaths and snowbeds, three habitats with very contrasting abiotic conditions. We also assessed within-habitat differences by comparing three widespread microhabitats (patches with high cover of Dryas, Salix, or bare soil). The data suggest that, along the sampled mesotopographic gradient, the greatest differences in both fungal richness and community composition are observed amongst habitats, while the effect of microhabitat is weaker, although still significant. Furthermore, we found that richness and community composition of fungi are shaped primarily by abiotic factors and to a lesser, though still significant extent, by floristic composition. Along this mesotopographic gradient, environmental severity is strongly correlated with richness in all fungal functional groups: positively in saprotrophic, pathogenic and lichenised fungi, and negatively in ectomycorrhizal and root endophytic fungi. Our results suggest complex interactions amongst functional groups, possibly due to nutrient limitation or competitive exclusion, with potential implications on soil carbon stocks. These findings are important in the light of the environmental changes predicted for the Arctic.},

	abstract = {1 Much attention has been paid to negative effects of alien species on resident communities but studies that quantify community-level effects of a number of invasive plants are scarce. We address this issue by assessing the impact of 13 species invasive in the Czech Republic on a wide range of plant communities. 2 Vegetation in invaded and uninvaded plots with similar site conditions was sampled. All species of vascular plants were recorded, their covers were estimated and used as importance values for calculating the Shannon diversity index H′, evenness J and Sørensen index of similarity between invaded and uninvaded vegetation. 3 With the exception of two invasive species, species richness, diversity and evenness were reduced in invaded plots. Species exhibiting the greatest impact reduced species numbers per plot and the total number of species recorded in the communities sampled by almost 90\%. A strong reduction of species number at the plot scale resulted in a marked reduction in the total species number at the landscape scale, and in less similarity between invaded and uninvaded vegetation. The decrease in species richness in invaded compared to uninvaded plots is largely driven by the identity of the invading species, whereas the major determinants of the decrease in Shannon diversity and evenness are the cover and height of invading species, and differences between height and cover of invading and dominant native species, independent of species identity. 4 Synthesis. Management decisions based on impact need to distinguish between invasive species, as their effects on diversity and composition of resident vegetation differ largely. Tall invading species capable of forming populations with the cover markedly greater than that of native dominant species exert the most severe effects on species diversity and evenness. Since a strong impact on the community scale is associated with reduction in species diversity at higher scales, invaders with a high impact represent a serious hazard to the landscape.},

	abstract = {1. In the face of natural complexities and multicollinearity, model selection and predictions using multiple regression may be ambiguous and risky. Confounding effects of predictors often cloud researchers’ assessment and interpretation of the single best ‘magic model’. The shortcomings of stepwise regression have been extensively described in statistical literature, yet it is still widely used in ecological literature. Similarly, hierarchical regression which is thought to be an improvement of the stepwise procedure, fails to address multicollinearity. 2. We propose that regression commonality analysis (CA), a technique more commonly used in psychology and education research will be helpful in interpreting the typical multiple regression analyses conducted on ecological data. 3. CA decomposes the variance of R2 into unique and common (or shared) variance (or effects) of predictors, and hence, it can significantly improve exploratory capabilities in studies where multiple regressions are widely used, particularly when predictors are correlated. CA can explicitly identify the magnitude and location of multicollinearity and suppression in a regression model. In this paper, using a simulated (from a correlation matrix) and an empirical dataset (human habitat selection, migration of Canadians across cities), we demonstrate how CA can be used with correlated predictors in multiple regression to improve our understanding and interpretation of data. We strongly encourage the use of CA in ecological research as a follow-on analysis from multiple regressions.},

The essential idea underlying this generalization is to examine the impact on the precision of estimation—in particular, the size of an ellipsoidal joint confidence region for β 1—of less-than-optimal selection of other columns of the design matrix (X 2), treating still other columns (X 0) as unalterable, even hypothetically. In typical applications, X 1 contains a set of dummy regressors coding categories of a qualitative variable or a set of polynomial regressors in a quantitative variable; X 2 contains all other regressors in the model, save the constant, which is in X 0. If σ 2 V denotes the realized variance of , and σ 2 U is the variance associated with an optimal selection of X 2, then the corresponding scaled dispersion ellipsoids to be compared are ℰ v = x : x′V –1 x ≤ 1 and ℰ U = x : x′U –1 x ≤ 1, where ℰ U is contained in ℰ v . The two ellipsoids can be compared by considering the radii of ℰ v relative to ℰ U , obtained through the spectral decomposition of V relative to U. We proceed to explore the geometry of generalized variance inflation, to show the relationship of these measures to correlation-matrix determinants and canonical correlations, to consider X matrices structured by relations of marginality among regressor subspaces, to develop the relationship of generalized variance inflation to hypothesis tests in the multivariate normal linear model, and to present several examples.},

While diversity may buffer plant communities against the negative effects of drought, the mechanisms underlying this pattern remain unclear. Higher diversity plant communities may have a higher likelihood of including more drought resistant species that can compensate for drought-sensitive species (“insurance effects”). Alternatively, higher diversity communities may alter environmental conditions and improve performance of even drought sensitive species. Here we planted non-leguminous forbs and grasses into monocultures, four-, and eight species mixtures and measured species and plot productivity every year from 2000 to 2010. We found that six of our eight species were suppressed when growing in monoculture during dry years. These same species were unaffected by drought when growing in higher diversity mixtures. Due to this poor performance in monoculture (not insurance effects), the biodiversity productivity relationship was strongest during the driest years. If biodiversity ameliorates hot/dry conditions and therefore improves performance of drought sensitive species during periods of low rainfall, this may mean biodiversity can be used as a tool to protect individual species from drought conditions.},

Using numerical simulations, I quantified the impact of multicollinearity on ecological multiple regression and found that even low levels of collinearity bias analyses (r ≥ 0.28 or r2 ≥ 0.08), causing (1) inaccurate model parameterization, (2) decreased statistical power, and (3) exclusion of significant predictor variables during model creation. Then, using real ecological data, I demonstrated the utility of various statistical techniques for enhancing the reliability and interpretation of ecological multiple regression in the presence of multicollinearity.},

These individual-based networks merge with each other, forming species-based networks and food webs that describe the architecture of ecological communities. Networks at broader spatiotemporal scales portray the structure of ecological interactions across landscapes and over macroevolutionary time. Here, I review the patterns observed in ecological networks across multiple levels of biological organization. A fundamental challenge is to understand the amount of interdependence as we move from individual-based networks to species-based networks and beyond. Despite the uneven distribution of studies, regularities in network structure emerge across scales due to the fundamental architectural patterns shared by complex networks and the interplay between traits and numerical effects. I illustrate the integration of these organizational scales by exploring the consequences of the emergence of highly connected species for network structures across scales.

	abstract = {Aim Biotic homogenization (BH), a reduction in the distinctness of species composition between geographically separated ecological communities in a region, is an important but underappreciated potential consequence of biological invasions. While BH theory has always considered invasions, it has generally been in a relatively narrow context that the cosmopolitan nature of invasive species increases BH because of their shared presence across many locations. We sought to evaluate this component of BH as well as broader effects of invasive species on BH through changes in native communities, including overall reductions in species richness or shifts in species composition. Location Minnesota, USA. Time period 2002–2014. Major taxa studied Aquatic macrophytes, including both vascular plants and attached macroalgae. Methods We used surveys of aquatic macrophyte communities from 1,102 shallow lakes in Minnesota, USA (including 248 lakes with repeated surveys) to evaluate relationships between invasion, native species and BH. Results We found that the presence of invasive species was associated with BH and that this pattern was reflected in both the total community (i.e., with invasive species included) and in the composition of the native species community alone. We found that invaded lakes were more compositionally similar to each other than uninvaded lakes, but that both groups were becoming more similar over time—despite neither group exhibiting declines in species richness. This pattern was largely driven by shifts in the native community itself, with common species becoming more widespread and rare species becoming rarer. Main conclusions Invasive species increase measures of community similarity through their own presence in multiple locations, and also by influencing the composition of native species. These patterns have important implications for conservation and management and suggest that BH should be considered more widely in evaluating the impacts of biological invasions and developing response strategies.},

We explored the relationships of LCBD and SCBD to site and species characteristics, respectively, in stream insect assemblages. We found that LCBD was mostly explained by variation in species richness, with a negative relationship being detected. SCBD was strongly related to various species characteristics, such as occupancy, abundance, niche position and niche breadth, but was only weakly related to biological traits of species. In particular, occupancy and its quadratic terms showed a very strong unimodal relationship with SCBD, suggesting that intermediate species in terms of site occupancy contribute most to beta diversity. Our findings of unravelling the contributions of sites or species to overall beta diversity are of high importance to community ecology, conservation and bioassessment using stream insect assemblages, and may bear some overall generalities to be found in other organism groups.},

We show how the total variance of Y can be calculated either directly or through a dissimilarity matrix obtained using any dissimilarity index deemed appropriate for pairwise comparisons of community composition data. We addressed the question of which index to use by coding 16 indices using 14 properties that are necessary for beta assessment, comparability among data sets, sampling issues and ordination. Our comparison analysis classified the coefficients under study into five types, three of which are appropriate for beta diversity assessment. Our approach links the concept of beta diversity with the analysis of community data by commonly used methods like ordination and anova. Total beta can be partitioned into Species Contributions (SCBD: degree of variation of individual species across the study area) and Local Contributions (LCBD: comparative indicators of the ecological uniqueness of the sites) to Beta Diversity. Moreover, total beta can be broken up into within- and among-group components by manova, into orthogonal axes by ordination, into spatial scales by eigenfunction analysis or among explanatory data sets by variation partitioning.},

Ambitious targets have been proposed, such as reversing the declining trends in biodiversity3; however, just feeding the growing human population will make this a challenge4. Here we use an ensemble of land-use and biodiversity models to assess whether—and how—humanity can reverse the declines in terrestrial biodiversity caused by habitat conversion, which is a major threat to biodiversity5. We show that immediate efforts, consistent with the broader sustainability agenda but of unprecedented ambition and coordination, could enable the provision of food for the growing human population while reversing the global terrestrial biodiversity trends caused by habitat conversion. If we decide to increase the extent of land under conservation management, restore degraded land and generalize landscape-level conservation planning, biodiversity trends from habitat conversion could become positive by the mid-twenty-first century on average across models (confidence interval, 2042–2061), but this was not the case for all models. Food prices could increase and, on average across models, almost half (confidence interval, 34–50\%) of the future biodiversity losses could not be avoided. However, additionally tackling the drivers of land-use change could avoid conflict with affordable food provision and reduces the environmental effects of the food-provision system. Through further sustainable intensification and trade, reduced food waste and more plant-based human diets, more than two thirds of future biodiversity losses are avoided and the biodiversity trends from habitat conversion are reversed by 2050 for almost all of the models. Although limiting further loss will remain challenging in several biodiversity-rich regions, and other threats—such as climate change—must be addressed to truly reverse the declines in biodiversity, our results show that ambitious conservation efforts and food system transformation are central to an effective post-2020 biodiversity strategy.},

The meta-ecosystem perspective thereby has the potential to integrate the perspectives of community and landscape ecology, to provide novel fundamental insights into the dynamics and functioning of ecosystems from local to global scales, and to increase our ability to predict the consequences of land-use changes on biodiversity and the provision of ecosystem services to human societies.},

Greater biodiversity is expected to enhance stability across years by decreasing synchrony among species, but the drivers of stability in nature remain poorly resolved. Our analysis of time series from 79 datasets across the world showed that stability was associated more strongly with the degree of synchrony among dominant species than with species richness. The relatively weak influence of species richness is consistent with theory predicting that the effect of richness on stability weakens when synchrony is higher than expected under random fluctuations, which was the case in most communities. Land management, nutrient addition, and climate change treatments had relatively weak and varying effects on stability, modifying how species richness, synchrony, and stability interact. Our results demonstrate the prevalence of biotic drivers on ecosystem stability, with the potential for environmental drivers to alter the intricate relationship among richness, synchrony, and stability.},

	abstract = {Stream monitoring data provides insights into the biological, chemical and physical status of running waters. Additionally, it can be used to identify drivers of chemical or ecological water quality, to inform related management actions, and to forecast future conditions under land use and global change scenarios. Measurements from sites along the same stream may not be statistically independent, and the R package SSN provides a way to describe spatial autocorrelation when modelling relationships between measured variables and potential drivers. However, SSN requires the user to provide the stream network and sampling locations in a certain format. Likewise, other applications require catchment delineation and intersection of different spatial data. We developed the R package openSTARS that provides the functionality to derive stream networks from a digital elevation model, delineate stream catchments and intersect them with land use or other GIS data as potential predictors. Additionally, locations for model predictions can be generated automatically along the stream network. We present an example workflow of all data preparation steps. In a case study using data from water monitoring sites in Southern Germany, the resulting stream network and derived site characteristics matched those constructed using STARS, an ArcGIS custom toolbox. An advantage of openSTARS is that it relies on free and open-source GRASS GIS and R functions, unlike the original STARS toolbox which depends on proprietary ArcGIS. openSTARS also comes without a graphical user interface, to enhance reproducibility and reusability of the workflow, thereby harmonizing and simplifying the data pre-processing prior to statistical modelling. Overall, openSTARS facilitates the use of spatial regression and other applications on stream networks and contributes to reproducible science with applications in hydrology, environmental sciences and ecology.},

This is because co-occurrence among species is a measurable metric in community datasets that, in the context of phylogeny, geography, traits, and environment, can sometimes indicate the degree of competition, displacement, and phylogenetic repulsion as weighed against biotic and environmental eﬀects promoting correlated species distributions. Historically, a multitude of diﬀerent co-occurrence metrics have been developed and most have depended on data randomization procedures to produce null distributions for signiﬁcance testing.

	abstract = {Aim To develop a new probabilistic model that can be used to test for statistically significant pair-wise patterns of species co-occurrence. The model gives the probability that two species would co-occur at a frequency less than (or greater than) the observed frequency if the two species were distributed independently of one another among a set of sites. The model can be used to classify species associations as negative, positive or random. Innovation Historically, the analysis of species co-occurrence has involved the use of data randomization. An observed species presence–absence matrix is compared with randomized matrices to determine if the observed matrix has structure, either an excess or deficit of species positively or negatively associated with each other. The computer algorithms used to randomize matrices can sometimes produce Type I and Type II errors (when the randomization algorithm produces a biased set of all possible matrices) due to the randomization process itself. The probabilistic model does not rely on any data randomization, hence it has a very low Type I error rate and is powerful having a low Type II error rate. Main conclusions When applied to 10 different data sets the probabilistic model revealed significant positive and negative species associations in most of the data sets. Compared with previous analyses the model tended to find fewer significant associations; this may indicate a generally low rate of Type I error in the model. The model is easy to implement and requires no special software. The model could potentially transform the way that ecologists test for species co-occurrence in a wide range of ecological studies.},

	abstract = {Understanding the ability of species to shift their distribution ranges in response to climate change is crucial for conservation biologists and resources managers. Although freshwater ecosystems include some of the most imperilled fauna worldwide, such range shifts have been poorly documented in streams and rivers and have never been compared to the current velocity of climate change. Based on national monitoring data, we examined the distributional changes of 32 stream fish species in France and quantified potential time lags in species responses, providing a unique opportunity to analyze range shifts over recent decades of warming in freshwater environments. A multi-facetted approach, based on several range measures along spatial gradients, allowed us to quantify range shifts of numerous species across the whole hydrographic network between an initial period (1980–1992) and a contemporary one (2003–2009), and to contrast them to the rates of isotherm shift in elevation and stream distance. Our results highlight systematic species shifts towards higher elevation and upstream, with mean shifts in range centre of 13.7 m decade−1 and 0.6 km decade−1, respectively. Fish species displayed dispersal-driven expansions along the altitudinal gradient at their upper range limit (61.5 m decade−1), while substantial range contractions at the lower limit (6.3 km decade−1) were documented for most species along the upstream–downstream gradient. Despite being consistent with the geographic variation in climate change velocities, these patterns reveal that the majority of stream fish have not shifted at a pace sufficient to track changing climate, in particular at their range centre where range shifts lag far behind expectation. Our study provides evidence that stream fish are currently responding to recent climate warming at a greater rate than many terrestrial organisms, although not as much as needed to cope with future climate modifications.},

Here, we assess changes over time in stream fish communities, quantify the extent to which these changes are attributable to population declines or increases and identify their main drivers. Location France. Time period 1980–2012. Major taxa studied Stream fish species. Methods We used abundance-monitoring data to quantify changes in composition and uniqueness for 332 stream fish communities between a cold historical period (1980–1993) and a warm contemporary period (2004–2012). Then, we used a model-averaging procedure to test the impacts of factors related to climate, land use and non-native species density and their interacting effects in shaping community reorganization. Results We observed biotic homogenization over time in stream fish communities, although some communities experienced differentiation. Changes in composition mainly resulted from population declines and were favoured by an increase in temperature seasonality and in non-native species density. Population declines decreased with fragmentation and changes in non-native species density, whereas population increases were negatively driven by changes in precipitation and positively by fragmentation. Our results provide evidence that environmental changes can interact with other factors (e.g., upstream–downstream, fragmentation intensity) to determine community reorganization. Main conclusions In the context of global change, fish assemblage reorganizations mainly result from population declines of species. These reorganizations are spatially structured and driven by both climatic and human-related stressors. Here, we emphasize the need to take into account several components of global change, because the interplay between stressors might play a key role in the ongoing biodiversity changes.},

	abstract = {The relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning (BEF) is a topic of considerable interest to scientists and managers because a better understanding of its underlying mechanisms may help us mitigate the consequences of biodiversity loss on ecosystems. Our current knowledge of BEF relies heavily on theoretical and experimental studies, typically conducted on a narrow range of spatio-temporal scales, environmental conditions, and trophic levels. Hence, whether a relationship holds in the natural environment is poorly understood, especially in exploited marine ecosystems. Using large-scale observations of marine fish communities, we applied a structural equation modelling framework to investigate the existence and significance of BEF relationships across northwestern European seas. We find that ecosystem functioning, here represented by spatial patterns in total fish biomass, is unrelated to species richness—the most commonly used diversity metric in BEF studies. Instead, community evenness, differences in species composition, and abiotic variables are significant drivers. In particular, we find that high fish biomass is associated with fish assemblages dominated by a few generalist species of a high trophic level, who are able to exploit both the benthic and pelagic energy pathway. Our study provides a better understanding of the mechanisms behind marine ecosystem functioning and allows for the integration of biodiversity into management considerations.},

However, it is not yet clear how diversity and biomass change simultaneously and how they are related to each other over time (e.g. in succession) at one locality. This study develops a temporal model based on the projected changes of various community variables in a generalized terrestrial environment after fire and uses post-fire succession data on Santa Monica Mountains of southern California and other published succession data to examine the temporal diversity-biomass relationships. The results indicate that in the early stages of succession, both diversity and biomass increase and a positive relationship appears, while in the late stages of succession, biomass continued to increase but diversity usually declines; thus a negative relationship may be observed. When the scales of measurement become sufficiently large so that the measured diversity and biomass cross various stages of succession, a ‘hump-shaped’ relationship can emerge. The diversity-biomass relationship appears to be concordant in space and time when appropriate scales are used. Formerly proposed explanations for spatial patterns may well apply to the temporal patterns (particularly colonization, facilitation and competitive exclusion).},

	abstract = {Global concern about human impact on biological diversity has triggered an intense research agenda on drivers and consequences of biodiversity change in parallel with international policy seeking to conserve biodiversity and associated ecosystem functions. Quantifying the trends in biodiversity is far from trivial, however, as recently documented by meta-analyses, which report little if any net change in local species richness through time. Here, we summarise several limitations of species richness as a metric of biodiversity change and show that the expectation of directional species richness trends under changing conditions is invalid. Instead, we illustrate how a set of species turnover indices provide more information content regarding temporal trends in biodiversity, as they reflect how dominance and identity shift in communities over time. We apply these metrics to three monitoring datasets representing different ecosystem types. In all datasets, nearly complete species turnover occurred, but this was disconnected from any species richness trends. Instead, turnover was strongly influenced by changes in species presence (identities) and dominance (abundances). We further show that these metrics can detect phases of strong compositional shifts in monitoring data and thus identify a different aspect of biodiversity change decoupled from species richness. Synthesis and applications: Temporal trends in species richness are insufficient to capture key changes in biodiversity in changing environments. In fact, reductions in environmental quality can lead to transient increases in species richness if immigration or extinction has different temporal dynamics. Thus, biodiversity monitoring programmes need to go beyond analyses of trends in richness in favour of more meaningful assessments of biodiversity change.},

Recent meta-analyses concluded that most communities are undergoing compositional change despite no net change in local species richness. We explored how species richness and composition of co-occurring plant, grasshopper, breeding bird and small mammal communities in arid and mesic grasslands changed in response to increasing aridity and fire frequency. In the arid system, grassland and shrubland plant and breeding bird communities were undergoing directional change, whereas grasshopper and small mammal communities were stable. In the mesic system, all communities were undergoing directional change regardless of fire frequency. Despite directional change in composition in some communities, species richness of all communities did not change because compositional change resulted more from reordering of species abundances than turnover in species composition. Thus, species reordering, not changes in richness, explains long-term dynamics in these grass and shrub dominated communities.},

	abstract = {Ecology Letters (2010) 13: 881–890 Abstract The number of trophic transfers occurring between basal resources and top predators, food chain length (FCL), varies widely in the world’s ecosystems for reasons that are poorly understood, particularly for stream ecosystems. Available evidence indicates that FCL is set by energetic constraints, environmental stochasticity, or ecosystem size effects, although no single explanation has yet accounted for FCL patterns in a broad sense. Further, whether environmental disturbance can influence FCL has been debated on both theoretical and empirical grounds for quite some time. Using data from sixteen South Island, New Zealand streams, we determined whether the so-called ecosystem size, disturbance, or resource availability hypotheses could account for FCL variation in high country fluvial environments. Stable isotope-based estimates of maximum trophic position ranged from 2.6 to 4.2 and averaged 3.5, a value on par with the global FCL average for streams. Model-selection results indicated that stream size and disturbance regime best explained across-site patterns in FCL, although resource availability was negatively correlated with our measure of disturbance; FCL approached its maximum in large, stable springs and was {\textless}3.5 trophic levels in small, fishless and/or disturbed streams. Community data indicate that size influenced FCL, primarily through its influence on local fish species richness (i.e., via trophic level additions and/or insertions), whereas disturbance did so via an effect on the relative availability of intermediate predators (i.e., predatory invertebrates) as prey for fishes. Overall, our results demonstrate that disturbance can have an important food web-structuring role in stream ecosystems, and further imply that pluralistic explanations are needed to fully understand the range of structural variation observed for real food webs.},

Knowledge of the mechanisms underlying the responses to rising temperatures depends heavily on generic food-web models that do not account for changes in network structure along latitudes and temperature gradients. Using 124 marine rock-pool food webs sampled across four continents, we show that despite substantial variation in ambient temperature (mean 11.5–28.4 °C), similar empirical food-web and body-mass structures emerge. We have used dynamic modelling to test whether communities from warmer regions are more sensitive to warming and found a general hump-shaped relationship between simulated biodiversity and temperature (gradient from 0–50 °C). This implies that an expected anthropogenic global warming of 4 °C should increase biodiversity in arctic to temperate regions while biodiversity in tropical regions should decrease. Interestingly, simulations of synthetic networks did not yield similar results, which stresses the importance of considering the specificities of natural food webs for predicting community responses to environmental changes.},

Yet, despite the importance of soil food webs for energy and nutrient turnover in terrestrial ecosystems, warming effects on these food webs—particularly in combination with other global change drivers—are largely unknown. Here, we present results from two complementary field experiments testing the interactive effects of warming with forest canopy disturbance and drought on energy fluxes in boreal-temperate ecotonal forest soil food webs. The first experiment applied a simultaneous above- and belowground warming treatment (ambient, +1.7°C, +3.4°C) to closed canopy and recently clear-cut forest, simulating common forest disturbance. The second experiment crossed warming with a summer drought treatment (-40\% rainfall) in the clear-cut habitats. We show that warming reduces energy fluxes to microbes, while forest canopy disturbance and drought facilitates warming-induced increases in energy flux to higher trophic levels and exacerbates reductions in energy flux to microbes, respectively. Contrary to expectations, we find no change in whole-network resilience to perturbations, but significant losses of ecosystem functioning. Warming thus interacts with forest disturbance and drought, shaping the energetic structure of soil food webs and threatening the provisioning of multiple ecosystem functions in boreal-temperate ecotonal forests.},

	abstract = {Effects of species diversity on population and community stability (or more precisely, the effects of species richness on temporal variability) have been studied for several decades, but there have been no large-scale tests in natural communities of predictions from theory. We used 91 data sets including plants, fish, small mammals, zooplankton, birds, and insects, to examine the relationship between species richness and temporal variability in populations and communities. Seventy-eight of 91 data sets showed a negative relationship between species richness and population variability; 46 of these relationships were statistically significant. Only five of the 13 positive richness-population variability relationships were statistically significant. Similarly, 51 of 91 data sets showed a negative relationship between species richness and community variability; of these, 26 were statistically significant. Seven of the 40 positive richness–community-variability relationships were statistically significant. We were able to test transferability (i.e., the predictive ability of models for sites that are spatially distinct from sites that were used to build the models) for 69 of 91 data sets; 35 and 31 data sets were transferable at the population and community levels, respectively. Only four were positive at the population level, and two at the community level. We conclude that there is compelling evidence of a negative relationship between species richness and temporal variability for about one-half of the ecological communities we examined. However, species richness explained relatively little of the variability in population or community abundances and resulted in small improvements in predictive ability.},

Determining the generality of this relationship, and discovering the mechanisms that underlie it, are vitally important for ecosystem management. Here, we investigate how species richness affects the temporal stability of biomass production by reanalyzing 27 recent biodiversity experiments conducted with primary producers. We find that, in grasslands, increasing species richness stabilizes whole-community biomass but destabilizes the dynamics of constituent populations. Community biomass is stabilized because species richness impacts mean biomass more strongly than its variance. In algal communities, species richness has a minimal effect on community stability because richness affects the mean and variance of biomass nearly equally. Using a new measure of synchrony among species, we find that for both grasslands and algae, temporal correlations in species biomass are lower when species are grown together in polyculture than when grown alone in monoculture. These results suggest that interspecific interactions tend to stabilize community biomass in diverse communities. Contrary to prevailing theory, we found no evidence that species’ responses to environmental variation in monoculture predicted the strength of diversity’s stabilizing effect. Together, these results deepen our understanding of when and why increasing species richness stabilizes community biomass.},

Community matrices were also used to derive estimates of interaction strengths between plankton groups. We found no relationship between temporal stability and stability measures derived from the community matrix. Weaker interaction strengths were generally associated with higher stability for community matrix measures of stability, but were not consistently associated with higher temporal stability. Temporal stability and stability measures derived from the community matrix stability appear to represent different aspects of stability reflecting the multi-dimensionality of stability.},

Much previous work is based on an assumption of identical (stable) species-level dynamics. We studied ecosystem models incorporating stable, cyclic and more complex species-level dynamics, with either linear or non-linear density dependence, within a locally stable community framework. Species composition varies with increasing diversity, interacting with the correlation of species' environmental responses to drive either positive or negative diversity-stability patterns, which theory based on communities with only stable species-level dynamics fails to predict.

Yet, a key component of this puzzle—the contributions of individual species to the overall stability of ecosystems—remains largely unknown. Here, we show that individual species simultaneously stabilize and destabilize ecosystems along different dimensions of stability, and also that their contributions to functional (biomass) and compositional stability are largely independent. By simulating experimentally the extinction of three consumer species (the limpet Patella, the periwinkle Littorina and the topshell Gibbula) from a coastal rocky shore, we found that the capacity to predict the combined contribution of species to stability from the sum of their individual contributions varied among stability dimensions. This implies that the nature of the diversity–stability relationship depends upon the dimension of stability under consideration, and may be additive, synergistic or antagonistic. We conclude that, although the profoundly multifaceted and context-dependent consequences of species loss pose a significant challenge, the predictability of cumulative species contributions to some dimensions of stability provide a way forward for ecologists trying to conserve ecosystems and manage their stability under global change.},

Policies to increase yields, irrigation and tolerance of crops to drought have been proposed as stability-enhancing solutions1,6,7. Here we evaluate a complementary possibility—that greater diversity of crops at the national level may increase the year-to-year stability of the total national harvest of all crops combined. We test this crop diversity–stability hypothesis using 5 decades of data on annual yields of 176 crop species in 91 nations. We find that greater effective diversity of crops at the national level is associated with increased temporal stability of total national harvest. Crop diversity has stabilizing effects that are similar in magnitude to the observed destabilizing effects of variability in precipitation. This greater stability reflects markedly lower frequencies of years with sharp harvest losses. Diversity effects remained robust after statistically controlling for irrigation, fertilization, precipitation, temperature and other variables, and are consistent with the variance-scaling characteristics of individual crops required by theory8,9 for diversity to lead to stability. Ensuring stable food supplies is a challenge that will probably require multiple solutions. Our results suggest that increasing national effective crop diversity may be an additional way to address this challenge.},

However, there has not yet been a unified framework to characterize the major trade-offs and axes of floral trait variation. Here, we propose the development of a floral economics spectrum (FES) that incorporates the multiple pathways by which floral traits can be shaped by multiple agents of selection acting on multiple flower functions. For example, while pollinator-mediated selection has been considered the primary factor affecting flower evolution, selection by nonpollinator agents can reinforce or oppose pollinator selection, and, therefore, affect floral trait variation. In addition to pollinators, the FES should consider nonpollinator biotic agents and floral physiological costs, broadening the drivers of floral traits beyond pollinators. We discuss how coordinated evolution and trade-offs among floral traits and between floral and vegetative traits may influence the distribution of floral traits across biomes and lineages, thereby influencing organismal evolution and community assembly.},

Over the last 30 years spatial ecology has developed as an integrative, multidisciplinary science that has improved our understanding of the ecological consequences of habitat fragmentation and loss. We argue that accelerating climate change – the effective manipulation of time by humans – has generated a current need to build an equivalent framework for temporal ecology. Climate change has at once pressed ecologists to understand and predict ecological dynamics in non-stationary environments, while also challenged fundamental assumptions of many concepts, models and approaches. However, similarities between space and time, especially related issues of scaling, provide an outline for improving ecological models and forecasting of temporal dynamics, while the unique attributes of time, particularly its emphasis on events and its singular direction, highlight where new approaches are needed. We emphasise how a renewed, interdisciplinary focus on time would coalesce related concepts, help develop new theories and methods and guide further data collection. The next challenge will be to unite predictive frameworks from spatial and temporal ecology to build robust forecasts of when and where environmental change will pose the largest threats to species and ecosystems, as well as identifying the best opportunities for conservation.},

Yet, understanding network dynamics is important in order to relate network patterns to ecological processes. We studied the day-to-day dynamics of an arctic pollination interaction network over two consecutive seasons. First, we found that new species entering the network tend to interact with already well-connected species, although there are deviations from this trend due, for example, to morphological mismatching between plant and pollinator traits and nonoverlapping phenophases of plant and pollinator species. Thus, temporal dynamics provides a mechanistic explanation for previously reported network patterns such as the heterogeneous distribution of number of interactions across species. Second, we looked for the ecological properties most likely to be mediating this dynamical process and found that both abundance and phenophase length were important determinants of the number of links per species.},

	abstract = {1. Network analysis is widely used in diverse fields and can be a powerful framework for studying the structure of biological systems. Temporal dynamics are a key issue for many ecological and evolutionary questions. These dynamics include both changes in network topology and flow on the network. Network analyses that ignore or do not adequately account for the temporal dynamics can result in inappropriate inferences. 2. We suggest that existing methods are currently under-utilized in many ecological and evolutionary network analyses and that the broader incorporation of these methods will considerably advance the current field. Our goal is to introduce ecologists and evolutionary biologists interested in studying network dynamics to extant ideas and methodological approaches, at a level appropriate for those new to the field. 3. We present an overview of time-ordered networks, which provide a framework for analysing network dynamics that addresses multiple inferential issues and permits novel types of temporally informed network analyses. We review available methods and software, discuss the utility and considerations of different approaches, provide a worked example analysis and highlight new research opportunities in ecology and evolutionary biology.},

	abstract = {The rank-abundance distribution (RAD) represents the manner in which species divide resources. Community-specific division rules that determine resource allocation among species, and thereby the shape of the RAD, have been hypothesized to account for observed stability of local species richness over time. While the shape of the RAD has been well studied, the temporal dynamics of this distribution have received much less attention. Here we assess changes in the shape of the RAD through time in a desert rodent community in Arizona (USA). Because energy use may be more appropriate for studying resource division than abundance, we also evaluate an energetic equivalent of the RAD. Significant, directional trends in the shapes of both distributions are present in this community. These changes are driven by trends in the relative abundances (or energy use) of Ranks 2, 3, and 4, and are significantly correlated with variation in total energy use by the community and with compositional change. Our results suggest that (1) rank-abundance and rank-energy distributions are not static and can change directionally through time, (2) species richness and rank distributions are not necessarily as intimately connected as early studies assumed, and (3) rank-abundance and rank-energy distributions are influenced by both the amount of energy available to the community and species-specific interactions.},

	abstract = {Biodiversity is rapidly declining1, and this may negatively affect ecosystem processes, including economically important ecosystem services. Previous studies have shown that biodiversity has positive effects on organisms and processes4 across trophic levels. However, only a few studies have so far incorporated an explicit food-web perspective. In an eight-year biodiversity experiment, we studied an unprecedented range of above- and below-ground organisms and multitrophic interactions. A multitrophic data set originating from a single long-term experiment allows mechanistic insights that would not be gained from meta-analysis of different experiments. Here we show that plant diversity effects dampen with increasing trophic level and degree of omnivory. This was true both for abundance and species richness of organisms. Furthermore, we present comprehensive above-ground/below-ground biodiversity food webs. Both above ground and below ground, herbivores responded more strongly to changes in plant diversity than did carnivores or omnivores. Density and richness of carnivorous taxa was independent of vegetation structure. Below-ground responses to plant diversity were consistently weaker than above-ground responses. Responses to increasing plant diversity were generally positive, but were negative for biological invasion, pathogen infestation and hyperparasitism. Our results suggest that plant diversity has strong bottom-up effects on multitrophic interaction networks, with particularly strong effects on lower trophic levels. Effects on higher trophic levels are indirectly mediated through bottom-up trophic cascades.},

	abstract = {Some ecosystems show nonlinear responses to gradual changes in environmental conditions, once a threshold in conditions—or critical point—is passed. This can lead to wide shifts in ecosystem states, possibly with dramatic ecological and economic consequences. Such behaviours have been reported in drylands, savannas, coral reefs or shallow lakes for example. Important research effort of the last decade has been devoted to identifying indicators that would help anticipate such ecosystem shifts and avoid their negative consequences. Theoretical and empirical research has shown that, as an ecosystem approaches a critical point, specific signatures arise in its temporal and spatial dynamics; these changes can be quantified using relatively simple statistical metrics that have been referred to as “early warning signals” (EWS) in the literature. Although tests of those EWS on experiments are promising, empirical evidence from out-of-laboratory datasets is still scarce, in particular for spatial EWS. The recent proliferation of remote-sensing data provides an opportunity to improve this situation and evaluate the reliability of spatial EWS in many ecological systems. Here, we present a step-by-step workflow along with code to compute spatial EWS from raster data such as aerial images, test their significance compared to permutation-based null models, and display their trends, either at different time steps or along environmental gradients. We created the R-package spatialwarnings (MIT license) to help achieve all these steps in a reliable and reproducible way, and thereby promote the application of spatial EWS to empirical data. This software package and associated documentation provides an easy entry point for researchers and managers into spatial EWS-based analyses. By facilitating a broader application, it will leverage the evaluation of spatial EWS on real data, and eventually contribute to providing tools to map ecosystems’ fragility to perturbations and inform management decisions.},

	abstract = {Interactions are key drivers of the functioning and fate of plant communities. A traditional way to measure them is to use pairwise experiments, but such experiments do not scale up to species-rich communities. For those, using association networks based on spatial patterns may provide a more realistic approach. While this method has been successful in abiotically-stressed environments (alpine and arid ecosystems), it is unclear how well it generalizes to other types of environments. We help fill this knowledge gap by documenting how the structure of plant communities changes in a Mediterranean dry grassland grazed by sheep using plant spatial association networks. We investigated how the structure of these networks changed with grazing intensity to show the effect of biotic disturbance on community structure. We found that these grazed grassland communities were mostly dominated by negative associations, suggesting a dominance of interference over facilitation regardless of the disturbance level. The topology of the networks revealed that the number of associations were not evenly-distributed across species, but rather that a small subset of species established most negative associations under low grazing conditions. All these aspects of spatial organization vanished under high level of grazing as association networks became more similar to null expectations. Our study shows that grazed herbaceous plant communities display a highly non-random organization that responds strongly to disturbance and can be measured through association networks. This approach thus appears insightful to test general hypotheses about plant communities, and in particular understand how anthropogenic perturbations affect the organization of ecological communities.},

	abstract = {Dryland ecosystems are likely to respond discontinuously to gradual changes in environmental conditions. Direct facilitation between plants, whereby plants improve the local environmental conditions for others, has been shown to be a mechanism contributing to these discontinuous ecosystem transitions. Theoretical models describing dryland vegetation dynamics often consider a single plant species and one type of facilitation, namely direct facilitation. However, another type of facilitation–indirect facilitation–is widespread in dryland ecosystems as well; it is performed by plants protected against grazing, the nurses, when this protection extends to other plants growing in their neighbourhood that are deprived of such protection, the protegees. Little is known about the long-term effects of indirect facilitation on dryland dynamics. Here, we developed and analysed a theoretical model including two species–a nurse and a protegee–and indirect facilitation through grazing. We investigated the effects of indirect facilitation on species composition, species spatial clustering and the stability of dryland ecosystems. We showed that indirect facilitation through grazing enables the stable coexistence of the nurse and the protegee and allows the reversibility of the protegee extinction. Surprisingly, the strength of indirect facilitation affected neither the total nor the interspecific vegetation clustering. Our study highlights that spatially explicit grazing protection may affect species composition and the stability of dryland ecosystems and gives hints about how species interactions translate into spatial clustering.},

	abstract = {Cannibals and their victims often share common resources and thus potentially compete. Smaller individuals are often competitively superior to larger ones because of size‐dependent scaling of foraging and metabolic rates, while larger ones may use cannibalism to counter this competition. We study the interplay between cannibalism and competition using a size‐structured population model in which all individuals consume a shared resource but in which larger ones may cannibalize smaller conspecifics. In this model, intercohort competition causes single‐cohort cycles when cannibalism is absent. Moderate levels of cannibalism reduce intercohort competition, enabling coexistence of many cohorts. More voracious cannibalism, in combination with competition, produces large‐amplitude cycles and a bimodal population size distribution with many small and few giant individuals. These coexisting ``dwarfs'' and ``giants'' have very different life histories, resulting from a reversal in importance of cannibalism and competition. The population structure at time of birth determines whether individuals suffer severe cannibalism, with the few survivors reaching giant sizes, or whether they suffer intense intracohort competition, with all individuals remaining small. These model results agree remarkably well with empirical data on perch population dynamics. We argue that the induction of cannibalistic giants in piscivorous fish is a population‐dynamic emergent phenomenon that requires a combination of size‐dependent cannibalism and competition.},

These diversity measures are hypothesized to be positively and strongly correlated, but this null hypothesis has not been tested empirically. We used the results of Caswell's neutral model to generate null relationships between richness (S), evenness (J′J′J{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}prime \}), and proportional diversity (H′H′H{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}prime \}). We tested predictions of the null model against empirical relationships describing data in a literature survey and in four individual studies conducted across various scales. Empirical relationships between logSlogS{\textbackslash}mathrm\{log\}{\textbackslash},S or J′J′J{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}prime \} and H′H′H{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}prime \} differed from the null model when {\textless}10 species were tested and in plants, vertebrates, and fungi. The empirical relationships were similar to the null model when {\textgreater}10 and {\textless}100 species were tested and in invertebrates. If {\textgreater}100 species were used to estimate diversity, the relation between logSlogS{\textbackslash}mathrm\{log\}{\textbackslash},S and H′H′H{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}prime \} was negative. The strongest predictive models included logSlogS{\textbackslash}mathrm\{log\}{\textbackslash},S and J′J′J{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}prime \}. A path analysis indicated that logSlogS{\textbackslash}mathrm\{log\}{\textbackslash},S and J′J′J{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}prime \} were always negatively related, that empirical observations could not be explained without including indirect effects, and that differences between the partials may indicate ecological effects, which suggests that S and J′J′J{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}prime \} act like diversity components or that diversity should be measured using a compound statistic.},

Here, we empirically test the space-for-time assumption by constructing orthogonal datasets of compositional turnover of plant taxa and climatic dissimilarity through time and across space from Late Quaternary pollen records in eastern North America, then modeling climate-driven compositional turnover. Predictions relying on space-for-time substitution were ∼72\% as accurate as “time-for-time” predictions. However, space-for-time substitution performed poorly during the Holocene when temporal variation in climate was small relative to spatial variation and required subsampling to match the extent of spatial and temporal climatic gradients. Despite this caution, our results generally support the judicious use of space-for-time substitution in modeling community responses to climate change.},

	abstract = {The main components of species diversity are richness and evenness. Species richness has been the subject of biodiversity studies more often than species evenness. Some simulated models suggest that the relationship between these two components is equal and predictable in a stable environment. This study was conducted in a human-shaped and unstable environment in arable field boundaries. A total of 30 sampling plots were laid out at random in the boundaries. Vegetation at the sites was of meadow type. The relationship between species richness and evenness, and their responses to edaphic nutrient factors in the field boundaries, were examined by correlation analysis and an ordination method. Correlation analyses demonstrated that no consistent pattern was present in the relationship between species evenness and species richness in this human-shaped ecosystem. Species richness and evenness also had different responses to edaphic factors, with species richness being negatively correlated with phosphorus, and species evenness negatively correlated with the ratio of organic carbon to total nitrogen in soil. The results indicate that different and independent ecological processes determine species richness and evenness. The relationship between these two components may be site-specific, reflecting variation in resource utilization by plant species. The pattern thus reflects the spatial heterogeneity of disturbances or ‘patchiness’ of resources between sites in a semi-natural ecosystem.},

The relationship between species richness and evenness (RRE) across communities remains, however, a controversial issue in ecology because no consistent pattern has been reported. We conducted a systematic meta-review of RRE in aquatic ecosystems along regional to continental gradients and across trophic groups, differing in body size by 13 orders of magnitude. Hypotheses that RRE responded to latitudinal and scale variability across trophic groups were tested by regression analyses. Significant correlations of species richness and evenness only existed in 71 out of 229 datasets. Among the RRE, 89 were negative and 140 were positive. RRE did not vary with latitude but showed a positive response to scale. In a meta-analysis with ecosystem type as a single explaining variable, RRE did not vary among ecosystem types, i.e. between marine and freshwater. Finally, autotrophs had more positive RRE than heterotrophs. The weak RRE in many aquatic datasets suggests that richness and evenness often reflect independent components of biodiversity, highlighting that richness alone may be an incomplete surrogate for biodiversity. Our results further elucidate that RRE is driven by organismal and environmental properties, both of which must be considered to gain a deeper understanding of large-scale patterns of biodiversity.},

	abstract = {We used natural phytoplankton communities from four coastal regions to test diversity-functioning relationships, relations of N2-fixing cyanobacteria to nutrient imbalance, and the importance of metacommunity dynamics. Resource availability was measured as total nitrogen and phosphorus. Resource imbalance was determined as (1) the ratio of dissolved inorganic nitrogen to total phosphorus and (2) an experimentally verified indicator quantified by modelling responses in 14C-based primary production to nutrient additions. Resource availability explained variance in biomass, productivity, and species richness, as expected by the Species Energy Theory, but not evenness. Linear mixed-effects models confirmed the overall relation between productivity and resource availability, whereas other resource availability relations showed also notable clustering by region. The Resource Ratio Theory predicting that diversity increases with the number of limiting resources was not supported. Nutrient imbalance had a weak effect on the biomass of N2-fixing cyanobacteria, but not their share of total phytoplankton biomass. Contrary to many previous studies on biodiversity-ecosystem functioning relationships, we found a highly significant inverse relationship between evenness and biomass. This indicates that species-rich natural phytoplankton communities form the basis for opportunistic species to temporarily monopolize resources and create blooms. The result was consistent across regions, although their community composition differed. Metacommunity dynamics were important, since distance between the regions explained higher percentage of the variability than local resources together. As the species able to monopolize resources vary widely in their role for aquatic food webs and environmental consequences (e.g., food quality, toxicity), species-level trait data is essential to understand better diversity-productivity relationships.},

This review examines the potential role of the emerging synthetic discipline of evolutionary community ecology in improving our understanding of how climate change will alter future distribution of biodiversity. We review theoretical and empirical advances about the role of niche evolution, interspecific interactions, and their interplay in altering species geographic ranges and community assembly. We discuss potential ways to integrate complex feedbacks between ecology and evolution in ecological forecasting. We also point at a number of caveats in our understanding of the eco-evolutionary consequences of climate change and highlight several challenges for future research.},

	abstract = {The restoration of floodplain grasslands has benefited from many studies of the underlying mechanisms. Among the operational tools that resulted, hay transfer is now used increasingly to alleviate the effects of limited seed dispersal and recruitment. To improve this method, we still need to understand how it can affect restoration trajectories, and particularly their direction and magnitude during the early stages of restoration. Based on concepts from the field of community ecology theory, we investigated the effects of early‐stage management through grazing or mowing on restoration trajectories after soil harrowing and hay transfer. We established a randomized block design experiment and quantified several community‐related metrics to formalize restoration trajectories for 3 years after hay transfer on a previously arable alluvial island in southwestern France. Whatever the management treatment, the species richness and evenness were significantly higher in hay‐inoculated than in control plots. This effect was linked to the recruitment of species originating not only from the reference grassland through hay transfer, but also from the seed bank, a well‐known effect of soil harrowing. Although generally oriented toward the reference grassland, the origin, direction, and magnitude of the trajectory of hay‐inoculated plots all depended on the management applied. Sheep grazing applied at the same time as hay transfer enhanced the recruitment of reference species as from the first experimental year, because it controlled aboveground competition and maintained the window of opportunity open for a sufficiently longer period of time. Our findings show that the type of management applied simultaneously to hay transfer influences the origin of a grassland trajectory, while its direction and magnitude are dependent on the management applied in subsequent years. Grazing immediately after hay transfer may be appropriate to accelerate the recruitment of species from the reference grassland.},

One of the key aspects of food web structure is complexity, or connectance, the number of links expressed as a proportion of the total possible number of links. Connectance (complexity) is linked to the stability of webs and is a key parameter in recent models of other aspects of web structure. However, there is still no fundamental biological explanation for connectance in food webs. Here, we propose that constraints on diet breadth, driven by optimal foraging, provide such an explanation. We show that a simple diet breadth model predicts highly constrained values of connectance as an emergent consequence of individual foraging behavior. When combined with features of real food web data, such as taxonomic and trophic aggregation and cumulative sampling of diets, the model predicts well the levels of connectance and scaling of connectance with species richness, seen in real food webs. This result is a previously undescribed synthesis of foraging theory and food web theory, in which network properties emerge from the behavior of individuals and, as such, provides a mechanistic explanation of connectance currently lacking in food web models.},

	abstract = {Robust predictions of predator–prey interactions are fundamental for the understanding of food webs, their structure, dynamics, resistance to species loss, response to invasions and ecosystem function. Most current food web models measure parameters at the food web level to predict patterns at the same level. Thus, they are sensitive to the quality of the data and may be ineffective in predicting non-observed interactions and disturbed food webs. There is a need for mechanistic models that predict the occurrence of a predator–prey interaction based on lower levels of organization (i.e. the traits of organisms) and the properties of their environment. Here, we present such a model that focuses on the predation act itself. We built a Newtonian, mechanical model for the processes of searching, capturing and handling of a prey item by a predator. Associated with general metabolic laws, we predict the net energy gain from predation for pairs of pelagic or flying predator species and their prey depending on their body sizes. Predicted interactions match well with data from the most extensive predator–prey database, and overall model accuracy is greater than the allometric niche model. Our model shows that it is possible to accurately predict the structure of food webs using only a few mechanical traits. It underlines the importance of physical constraints in structuring food webs.

Its drivers in competitive systems (sampling effect and functional complementarity) are intuitive and elegant, but we lack an integrative understanding of these drivers in complex ecosystems. Because networks encompass two key components of the BEF relationship (species richness and biomass ﬂow), they provide a key to identify these drivers, assuming that we have a meaningful measure of functional complementarity. In a network, diversity can be deﬁned by species richness, the number of trophic levels, but perhaps more importantly, the diversity of interactions. In this paper, we deﬁne the concept of trophic complementarity (TC), which emerges through exploitative and apparent competition processes, and study its contribution to ecosystem functioning. Using a model of trophic community dynamics, we show that TC predicts various measures of ecosystem functioning, and generate a range of testable predictions. We ﬁnd that, in addition to the number of species, the structure of their interactions needs to be accounted for to predict ecosystem productivity.},

Changes in ecosystem properties consecutive to cascading extinctions have received far less attention even though such dramatic events might strongly alter ecosystem functioning. Here we use various food web models to investigate the effects of species loss and diversity on both secondary extinctions and their associated changes in ecosystem properties. Our analysis shows that diversity has contrasting effects depending on the presence of self-limiting terms at consumer levels and, to a lower extent, on connectance and interspecific competition. Ecosystems that lose a high proportion of species through cascading extinctions exhibit the most important changes in ecosystem properties. Linking studies on cascading extinctions in food webs with studies that investigate the effects of biodiversity on ecosystem functioning appears crucial for a better understanding of the consequences of species extinctions.},

	abstract = {Comprehensive analyses of long–term (1977–2003) small–mammal abundance data from western Finland showed that populations of Microtus voles (field voles M.agrestis and sibling voles M.rossiaemeridionalis), bank voles (Clethrionomys glareolus) and common shrews (Sorex araneus) fluctuated synchronously in 3 year population cycles. Time–series analyses indicated that interspecific synchrony is influenced strongly by density–dependent processes. Synchrony among Microtus and bank voles appeared additionally to be influenced by density–independent processes. To test whether interspecific synchronization through density–dependent processes is caused by predation, we experimentally reduced the densities of the main predators of small mammals in four large agricultural areas, and compared small mammal abundances in these to those in four control areas (2.5–3 km2) through a 3 year small–mammal population cycle. Predator reduction increased densities of the main prey species, Microtus voles, in all phases of the population cycle, while bank voles, the most important alternative prey of predators, responded positively only in the low and the increase phase. Manipulation also increased the autumn densities of water voles (Arvicola terrestris) in the increase phase of the cycle. No treatment effects were detected for common shrews or mice. Our results are in accordance with the alternative prey hypothesis, by which predators successively reduce the densities of both main and alternative prey species after the peak phase of small–mammal population cycles, thus inducing a synchronous low phase.},

	abstract = {Predator–prey cycles rank among the most fundamental concepts in ecology, are predicted by the simplest ecological models and enable, theoretically, the indefinite persistence of predator and prey1–4. However, it remains an open question for how long cyclic dynamics can be self-sustained in real communities. Field observations have been restricted to a few cycle periods5–8 and experimental studies indicate that oscillations may be short-lived without external stabilizing factors9–19. Here we performed microcosm experiments with a planktonic predator–prey system and repeatedly observed oscillatory time series of unprecedented length that persisted for up to around 50 cycles or approximately 300 predator generations. The dominant type of dynamics was characterized by regular, coherent oscillations with a nearly constant predator–prey phase difference. Despite constant experimental conditions, we also observed shorter episodes of irregular, non-coherent oscillations without any significant phase relationship. However, the predator–prey system showed a strong tendency to return to the dominant dynamical regime with a defined phase relationship. A mathematical model suggests that stochasticity is probably responsible for the reversible shift from coherent to non-coherent oscillations, a notion that was supported by experiments with external forcing by pulsed nutrient supply. Our findings empirically demonstrate the potential for infinite persistence of predator and prey populations in a cyclic dynamic regime that shows resilience in the presence of stochastic events.},

In a three-year experiment set in the Mongolian steppe, we examined the response of the common grass Festuca lenensis to manipulated temperature and water while controlling for topographic variation, plant–plant interactions, and ecotypic differentiation. Plant survival and growth responses to a warmer, drier climate varied within the landscape. Response to simulated increased precipitation occurred only in the absence of neighbors, demonstrating that plant–plant interactions can supersede the effects of climate change. F. lenensis also showed evidence of local adaptation in populations that were only 300 m apart. Individuals from the steep and dry upper slope showed a higher stress/drought tolerance, whereas those from the more productive lower slope showed a higher biomass production and a greater ability to cope with competition. Moreover, the response of this species to increased precipitation was ecotype speciﬁc, with water addition beneﬁting only the least stress-tolerant ecotype from the lower slope origin. This multifaceted approach illustrates the importance of placing climate change experiments within a realistic ecological and evolutionary framework. Existing sources of variation impacting plant performance may buffer or obscure climate change effects.},

The multiple stressor framework emphasizes non-additive effects, but biodiversity may also buffer the effects of climate change, and climate change may alter which mechanisms underlie biodiversity–function relationships. Here, we performed an experiment using tank bromeliad ecosystems to test the various ways that rainfall changes and litter diversity may jointly determine ecological processes. Litter diversity and rainfall changes interactively affected multiple functions, but how depends on the process measured. High litter diversity buffered the effects of altered rainfall on detritivore communities, evidence of insurance against impacts of climate change. Altered rainfall affected the mechanisms by which litter diversity influenced decomposition, reducing the importance of complementary attributes of species (complementarity effects), and resulting in an increasing dependence on the maintenance of specific species (dominance effects). Finally, altered rainfall conditions prevented litter diversity from fueling methanogenesis, because such changes in rainfall reduced microbial activity by 58\%. Together, these results demonstrate that the effects of climate change and biodiversity loss on ecosystems cannot be understood in isolation and interactions between these stressors can be multifaceted.},

However, the current ecological equilibrium could be disrupted under climate change, with a faster upward range shift of animals than plants. Here, we experimentally simulated this upward herbivore range shift by translocating low-elevation herbivore insects to alpine grasslands. We report that the introduction of novel herbivores and increased herbivory disrupted the vertical functional organization of the plant canopy. By feeding preferentially on alpine plants with functional traits matching their low-elevation host plants, herbivores reduced the biomass of dominant alpine plant species and favored encroachment of herbivore-resistant small-stature plant species, inflating species richness. Supplementing a direct effect of temperature, novel biotic interactions represent a neglected but major driver of ecosystem modifications under climate change.},

	abstract = {Ecologists have long suspected that species are more likely to interact if their traits match in a particular way. For example, a pollination interaction may be more likely if the proportions of a bee's tongue fit a plant's flower shape. Empirical estimates of the importance of trait-matching for determining species interactions, however, vary significantly among different types of ecological networks. Here, we show that ambiguity among empirical trait-matching studies may have arisen at least in parts from using overly simple statistical models. Using simulated and real data, we contrast conventional generalized linear models (GLM) with more flexible Machine Learning (ML) models (Random Forest, Boosted Regression Trees, Deep Neural Networks, Convolutional Neural Networks, Support Vector Machines, naïve Bayes, and k-Nearest-Neighbor), testing their ability to predict species interactions based on traits, and infer trait combinations causally responsible for species interactions. We found that the best ML models can successfully predict species interactions in plant–pollinator networks, outperforming GLMs by a substantial margin. Our results also demonstrate that ML models can better identify the causally responsible trait-matching combinations than GLMs. In two case studies, the best ML models successfully predicted species interactions in a global plant–pollinator database and inferred ecologically plausible trait-matching rules for a plant–hummingbird network from Costa Rica, without any prior assumptions about the system. We conclude that flexible ML models offer many advantages over traditional regression models for understanding interaction networks. We anticipate that these results extrapolate to other ecological network types. More generally, our results highlight the potential of machine learning and artificial intelligence for inference in ecology, beyond standard tasks such as image or pattern recognition.},

	abstract = {In this paper we investigate the consequences of size-dependent competition among the individuals of a consumer population by analyzing the dynamic properties of a physiologically structured population model. Only 2 size-classes of individuals are distinguished: juveniles and adults. Juveniles and adults both feed on one and the same resource and hence interact by means of exploitative competition. Juvenile individuals allocate all assimilated energy into development and mature on reaching a fixed developmental threshold. The combination of this fixed threshold and the resource-dependent developmental rate, implies that the juvenile delay between birth and the onset of reproduction may vary in time. Adult individuals allocate all assimilated energy to reproduction. Mortality of both juveniles and adults is assumed to be inversely proportional to the amount of energy assimilated. In this setting we study how the dynamics of the population are influenced by the relative foraging capabilities of juveniles and adults. In line with results that we previously obtained in size-structured consumer–resource models with pulsed reproduction, population cycles primarily occur when either juveniles or adults have a distinct competitive advantage. When adults have a larger per capita feeding rate and are hence competitively superior to juveniles, population oscillations occur that are primarily induced by the fact that the duration of the juvenile period changes with changing food conditions. These cycles do not occur when the juvenile delay is a fixed parameter. When juveniles are competitively superior, two different types of population fluctuations can occur: (1) rapid, low-amplitude fluctuations having a period of half the juvenile delay and (2) slow, large-amplitude fluctuations characterized by a period, which is roughly equal to the juvenile delay. The analysis of simplified versions of the structured model indicates that these two types of oscillations also occur if mortality and/or development is independent of food density, i.e. in a situation with a constant juvenile developmental delay and a constant, food-independent background mortality. Thus, the oscillations that occur when juveniles are more competitive are induced by the juvenile delay per se. When juveniles exert a larger foraging pressure on the shared resource, maturation implies an increase not only in adult density, but also in food density and consequently fecundity. Our analysis suggests that this correlation in time between adult density and fecundity is crucial for the occurrence of population cycles when juveniles are competitively superior.},

Asynchronous ﬂuctuations in the densities of competing consumers can stabilize food web dynamics in constant environments. However, environmental ﬂuctuations often synchronize dynamics in nature. Using the same Ôdiamond-shapeÕ food web model ﬁrst used to demonstrate the stabilizing effects of asynchrony in constant environments, we show that weak-to-moderate environmentally induced ﬂuctuations in consumer mortality rates stabilize food webs while disrupting asynchrony. Synchrony actually promotes stability because: (i) synchronous declines in consumer density reduce the maximum abundance of top predators and (ii) resource competition quickly converts synchronous increases in consumer density into synchronous declines. These results are robust to details of food web topology and the implementation of environmental ﬂuctuations. The ﬂuctuation strengths that enhance stability are within the range experienced naturally by many species, suggesting that stabilization via environmental ﬂuctuations is a realistic possibility.},

For example, will it be limited physiological tolerance to high temperatures, changing biotic interactions or other factors? Here, we systematically review the proximate causes of climate-change related extinctions and their empirical support. We find 136 case studies of climatic impacts that are potentially relevant to this topic. However, only seven identified proximate causes of demonstrated local extinctions due to anthropogenic climate change. Among these seven studies, the proximate causes vary widely. Surprisingly, none show a straightforward relationship between local extinction and limited tolerances to high temperature. Instead, many studies implicate species interactions as an important proximate cause, especially decreases in food availability. We find very similar patterns in studies showing decreases in abundance associated with climate change, and in those studies showing impacts of climatic oscillations. Collectively, these results highlight our disturbingly limited knowledge of this crucial issue but also support the idea that changing species interactions are an important cause of documented population declines and extinctions related to climate change. Finally, we briefly outline general research strategies for identifying these proximate causes in future studies.},

	abstract = {Rapid warming is a major threat for the alpine biodiversity but, at the same time, accelerated glacial retreat constitutes an opportunity for taxa and communities to escape range contraction or extinction. We explored the first steps of plant primary succession after accelerated glacial retreat under the assumption that the first few years are critical for the success of plant establishment. To this end, we examined plant succession along a very short post-glacial chronosequence in the tropical Andes of Ecuador (2–13 years after glacial retreat). We recorded the location of all plant individuals within an area of 4,200 m2 divided into plots of 1 m2. This sampling made it possible to measure the responses of the microenvironment, plant diversity and plants traits to time since the glacial retreat. It also made it possible to produce species-area curves and to estimate positive interactions between species. Decreases in soil temperature, soil moisture, and soil macronutrients revealed increasing abiotic stress for plants between two and 13 years after glacial retreat. This increasing stress seemingly explained the lack of positive correlation between plant diversity and time since the glacial retreat. It might explain the decreasing performance of plants at both the population (lower plant height) and the community levels (lower species richness and lower accumulation of species per area). Meanwhile, infrequent spatial associations among plants indicated a facilitation deficit and animal-dispersed plants were almost absent. Although the presence of 21 species on such a small sampled area seven years after glacial retreat could look like a colonization success in the first place, the increasing abiotic stress may partly erase this success, reducing species richness to 13 species after 13 years and increasing the frequency of patches without vegetation. This fine-grain distribution study sheds new light on nature’s responses to the effects of climate change in cold biomes, suggesting that faster glacial retreat would not necessarily result in accelerated plant colonization. Results are exploratory and require site replications for generalization.},

	abstract = {Glaciers cover about 10\% of the Earth’s land area but they are retreating rapidly and many will disappear within decades. Glacier retreat is a worldwide phenomenon increasing the threat to water resources, biodiversity and associated ecosystem services for hundreds of millions of people, mostly in developing countries. Our understanding of the ecological consequences of glacier retreat has improved significantly in the past decade, but we still lack a comprehensive framework for predicting biodiversity responses to glacier retreat globally, across diverse habitats and taxa. By conducting a global meta-analysis of 234 published studies, including more than 2,100 biodiversity surveys covering marine, freshwater and terrestrial assemblages, we show here that taxon abundance and richness generally increase at lower levels of glacier influence, suggesting that diversity increases locally as glaciers retreat. However, significant response heterogeneity was observed between study sites and species: 6–11\% of the studied populations, particularly in fjords, would lose out from glacier retreat. Most of the losers are specialist species, efficient dispersers, uniquely adapted to glacial conditions, whereas the winners are generalist taxa colonizing from downstream. Our global analyses also identify key geographic variables (glacier cover, isolation and melting rates, but not latitude or altitude) and species traits (body size and trophic position) likely to modulate taxon sensitivity to glacial retreat. Finally, we propose mechanistic diagrams for model development to predict biodiversity change following glacier retreat.},

	abstract = {Global warming causes the poleward shift of the trailing edges of marine ectotherm species distributions. In the semi-enclosed Mediterranean Sea, continental masses and oceanographic barriers do not allow natural connectivity with thermophilic species pools: as trailing edges retreat, a net diversity loss occurs. We quantify this loss on the Israeli shelf, among the warmest areas in the Mediterranean, by comparing current native molluscan richness with the historical one obtained from surficial death assemblages. We recorded only 12\% and 5\% of historically present native species on shallow subtidal soft and hard substrates, respectively. This is the largest climate-driven regional-scale diversity loss in the oceans documented to date. By contrast, assemblages in the intertidal, more tolerant to climatic extremes, and in the cooler mesophotic zone show approximately 50\% of the historical native richness. Importantly, approximately 60\% of the recorded shallow subtidal native species do not reach reproductive size, making the shallow shelf a demographic sink. We predict that, as climate warms, this native biodiversity collapse will intensify and expand geographically, counteracted only by Indo-Pacific species entering from the Suez Canal. These assemblages, shaped by climate warming and biological invasions, give rise to a ‘novel ecosystem’ whose restoration to historical baselines is not achievable.},

	abstract = {1. It is well known that climate change alters abiotic factors (temperature and water availability) that directly affect ecosystem properties. However, less is known about the indirect impacts of climate change on ecosystem structure and function. Here, we show that experimental warming may deteriorate ecosystems via trophic interactions. 2. In a Tibetan alpine meadow, plant species composition, size, coverage and above-ground biomass were investigated to reveal the effect of artificial warming (c. 1 °C mean annual temperature at the soil surface), which was accomplished using warmed and ambient open top chambers. In addition, rodent damage to plants was assessed. 3. The dicot forb silverweed Potentilla anserina increased significantly, while other species groups remained unchanged or decreased in plant community dominance rank after 2 years of artificial warming. The change in community structure was attributed to the difference in biomass allocation and growth form among species. 4. In the third year, plateau zokors Myospalax fontanierii, a widespread rodent herbivore, damaged plants in the warmed chambers, while leaving plants in the ambient chambers mostly undamaged. Above-ground biomass was found to be smaller in the warmed chambers than the controls in the third year, in contrast to the trend of the first 2 years. In addition, zokor burrow density was positively correlated with silverweed biomass and its dominance within communities, which was consistent with findings of independent field investigations that silverweed-dominated plots were more likely to be visited and damaged by the zokors than sites-dominated by grass species. 5. Synthesis and applications. The top-down negative effect of zokor damage on above-ground biomass in the warmed chambers was induced by the bottom-up effect of changes in species composition and community structure on zokor foraging behaviour, which were driven by artificial warming. Such trophic interactions may invalidate some predictions of ecological effects by current species-climate envelope models. Furthermore, because management measures including increasing the water table, planting grass and moderate cattle grazing may prevent silverweed dominance, we suggest that these interventions could be employed to control zokor damage in alpine meadows that are predicted to be drier and warmer in the future.},

The direction, frequency, and intensity of biotic interactions can in turn be altered by climate change. Understanding the complex interplay between climate and biotic interactions is thus essential for fully anticipating how ecosystems will respond to the fast rates of current warming, which are unprecedented since the end of the last glacial period. We highlight episodes of climate change that have disrupted ecosystems and trophic interactions over time scales ranging from years to millennia by changing species’ relative abundances and geographic ranges, causing extinctions, and creating transient and novel communities dominated by generalist species and interactions. These patterns emerge repeatedly across disparate temporal and spatial scales, suggesting the possibility of similar underlying processes. Based on these findings, we identify knowledge gaps and fruitful areas for research that will further our understanding of the effects of climate change on ecosystems.},

Through this mechanism, environmental temperature affects individuals and populations of poikilotherms by determining rates of resource use, growth, reproduction, and mortality. Predictable variation in metabolic processes such as growth and reproduction could affect the strength of species interactions, but the community-level consequences of metabolic temperature dependence are virtually unexplored. I experimentally tested the hypothesis that plant–herbivore interaction strength increases with temperature using a common species of marine macroalga (Sargassum ﬁlipendula) and the grazing amphipod Ampithoe longimana. Increasing temperature increased per capita interaction strength in two independent experiments and reversed a positive effect of temperature on plant growth. Temperature did not alter palatability of plant tissue to herbivores or average herbivore feeding rate. A predictable effect of temperature on herbivore–plant interaction strength could provide key information toward understanding local food web responses to changing temperatures at different spatial and temporal scales. Efforts to extend the effects of physiological mechanisms to larger scale patterns, including projections of the ecological effects of climate change, must be expanded to include the effects of changing conditions on trophic interactions.},

	abstract = {Predicted climate change in the Andes will require plant species to migrate upslope to avoid extinction. Central to predictions of species responses to climate change is an understanding of species distributions along environmental gradients. Environmental gradients are frequently modelled as abiotic, but biotic interactions can play important roles in setting species distributions, abundances, and life history traits. Biotic interactions also have the potential to inﬂuence species responses to climate change, yet they remain mostly unquantiﬁed. An important interaction long studied in tropical forests is postdispersal seed predation which has been shown to affect the population dynamics, community structure, and diversity of plant species in time and space. This paper presents a comparative seed predation study of 24 species of tropical trees across a 2.5 km elevation gradient in the Peruvian Andes and quantiﬁes seed predation variation across the elevational gradient. We then use demographic modelling to assess effects of the observed variation in seed predation on population growth rates in response to observed increasing temperatures in the area. We found marked variation among species in total seed predation depending on the major seed predator of the species and consistent changes in seed predation across the gradient. There was a signiﬁcant increase in seed survival with increasing elevation, a trend that appears to be driven by regulation of seed predators via top–down forces in the lowlands giving way to bottom–up (productivity) regulation at mid- to high elevations, resulting in a ninefold increase in effective fecundity for trees at high elevations. This potential increase in seed crop size strongly affects modelled plant population growth and seed dispersal distances, increasing population migration potential in the face of climate change. These results also indicate that species interactions can have effects on par with climate in species responses to global change.},

	abstract = {The flowering phenology of early-blooming plants is largely determined by snowmelt timing in high-latitude and high-altitude ecosystems. When the synchrony of flowering and pollinator emergence is disturbed by climate change, seed production may be restricted due to insufficient pollination success. We revealed the mechanism of phenological mismatch between a spring ephemeral (Corydalis ambigua) and its pollinator (overwintered bumblebees), and its impact on plant reproduction, based on 19 years of monitoring and a snow removal experiment in a cool-temperate forest in northern Japan. Early snowmelt increased the risk of phenological mismatch under natural conditions. Seed production was limited by pollination success over the 3 years of the pollination experiment and decreased when flowering occurred prior to bee emergence. Similar trends were detected on modification of flowering phenology through snow removal. Following snowmelt, the length of the pre-flowering period strongly depended on the ambient surface temperature, ranging from 4 days (at greater than 7°C) to 26 days (at 2.5°C). Flowering onset was explained with an accumulated surface degree-day model. Bumblebees emerged when soil temperature reached 6°C, which was predictable by an accumulated soil degree-day model, although foraging activity after emergence might depend on air temperature. These results indicate that phenological mismatch tends to occur when snow melts early but subsequent soil warming progresses slowly. Thus, modification of the snowmelt regime could be a major driver disturbing spring phenology in northern ecosystems.},

Ecological intensification of agriculture is a framework for increasing agricultural productivity by fostering supporting and regulating ecosystem services (ES) while reducing negative environmental impacts.

We also propose a set of technologies, practices and policies to preserve (or restore) the provision of these key ES: long fallowing, soil amendments, conservation tillage, rotational grazing, grassland ecological restoration, conservation of agrobiodiversity, modern irrigation and water harvesting, plant breeding, climate change mitigation schemes and payment for ecosystem services, and adapted traditional technologies.},

	abstract = {Scientific understanding of biodiversity dynamics, resulting from past climate oscillations and projections of future changes in biodiversity, has advanced over the past decade. Little is known about how these responses, past or future, are spatially connected. Analyzing the spatial variability in biodiversity provides insight into how climate change affects the accumulation of diversity across space. Here, we evaluate the spatial variation of phylogenetic diversity of European seed plants among neighboring sites and assess the effects of past rapid climate changes during the Quaternary on these patterns. Our work shows a marked homogenization in phylogenetic diversity across Central and Northern Europe linked to high climate change velocity and large distances to refugia. Our results suggest that the future projected loss in evolutionary heritage may be even more dramatic, as homogenization in response to rapid climate change has occurred among sites across large landscapes, leaving a legacy that has lasted for millennia.},

However, most studies focus on one interaction type at a time, leaving community ecologists unsure of how positive and negative associations among species combine to influence biodiversity patterns. Using surveys of plant populations in alpine communities worldwide, we explore patterns of positive and negative associations among triads of species (modules) and their relationship to local biodiversity. Three modules, each incorporating both positive and negative associations, were overrepresented, thus acting as "network motifs." Furthermore, the overrepresentation of these network motifs is positively linked to species diversity globally. A theoretical model illustrates that these network motifs, based on competition between facilitated species or facilitation between inferior competitors, increase local persistence. Our findings suggest that the interplay of competition and facilitation is crucial for maintaining biodiversity.},

	abstract = {In natural plant communities, one finds ample examples of both competitive and facilitative interactions. The effect of a species A on another species B is said to be competitive (facilitative) if an increase in A ’s population size reduces (enhances) the population growth rate of B . Competition may arise if two species live in the same habitat and are therefore occupying sites at the others’ expense. In turn, facilitation could happen, for example, because a plant species modifies the soil chemistry around itself in a way that makes it especially beneficial to members of another species. Is the prevalence of competitive and facilitative interactions merely a statistic associated with communities, or does it reveal other properties of interest? For instance, is it conducive to biodiversity to have either very many competitive or very many facilitative interactions within a community? In a recent study in PNAS, Losapio et al. (1) argue that the two are needed in concert. An overprevalence of certain combinations of competitive and facilitative interactions predictably leads to more plant species within a community.

Every species potentially interacts with many others. Communities can therefore be viewed as interaction networks (Fig. 1) in which each species is embedded (2). This must be taken into account when pondering the potential community-wide effects of competition and facilitation. Naively, competition may be thought of as a destructive force, hindering the coexistence of species. Things are not that simple, however, because of the principle that “the enemy’s enemy is a friend.” If two species are in competition and the second one is a superior competitor, it might drive the first one extinct—unless there is a third species that is also in competition with the second, keeping it sufficiently in check for all three of them to persist. Similarly, the naive logic that …

However, the lack of experimental support of this prediction has limited our understanding of how species interactions occurring within and across trophic levels simultaneously regulate the maintenance of biodiversity. Here, we integrate a mathematical approach and detailed experiments in plant–pollinator communities to demonstrate the need to jointly account for species interactions within and across trophic levels when estimating the ability of species to persist. Within the plant trophic level, we show that the persistence probability of plant species increases when introducing the effects of plant–pollinator interactions. Across trophic levels, we show that the persistence probabilities of both plants and pollinators exhibit idiosyncratic changes when experimentally manipulating the multitrophic structure. Importantly, these idiosyncratic effects are not recovered by traditional simulations. Our work provides tractable experimental and theoretical platforms upon which it is possible to investigate the multitrophic factors affecting species persistence in ecological communities.},

Here we study networks of plant and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal (AMF) communities along a 120 000 year soil chronosequence, as they undergo assembly (progression) and then disassembly (retrogression). We found that network assembly and disassembly were symmetrical, self-reinforcing processes that together were capable of generating key attributes of network architecture. Plant and AMF species that had short indirect paths to others in the community (i.e. high centrality), rather than many direct interaction partners (i.e. high degree), were best able to attract new interaction partners and, in the case of AMF species, also to retain existing interactions with plants during retrogression. We then show using simulations that these non-random patterns of attachment and detachment promote nestedness of the network. These results have implications for predicting extinction sequences, identifying focal points for invasions and suggesting trajectories for restoration.},

According to the insurance hypothesis, biodiversity insures ecosystems against declines in their functioning because many species provide greater guarantees that some will maintain functioning even if others fail. Here we examine this hypothesis theoretically. We develop a general stochastic dynamic model to assess the effects of species richness on the expected temporal mean and variance of ecosystem processes such as productivity, based on individual species’ productivity responses to environmental fluctuations. Our model shows two major insurance effects of species richness on ecosystem productivity: (i) a buffering effect, i.e., a reduction in the temporal variance of productivity, and (ii) a performance-enhancing effect, i.e., an increase in the temporal mean of productivity. The strength of these insurance effects is determined by three factors: (i) the way ecosystem productivity is determined by individual species responses to environmental fluctuations, (ii) the degree of asynchronicity of these responses, and (iii) the detailed form of these responses. In particular, the greater the variance of the species responses, the lower the species richness at which the temporal mean of the ecosystem process saturates and the ecosystem becomes redundant. These results provide a strong theoretical foundation for the insurance hypothesis, which proves to be a fundamental principle for understanding the long-term effects of biodiversity on ecosystem processes.},

We show that our understanding of stability has remained fragmented and is limited largely to simple or simplified systems. There has been a profusion of metrics proposed to quantify stability, of which only a handful are used commonly. Furthermore, studies typically quantify one to two metrics of stability at a time and in response to a single perturbation, with some of the main environmental pressures of today being the least studied. We argue that we need to build on the existing consensus and strong theoretical foundation of the stability concept to better understand its multidimensionality and the interdependencies between metrics, levels of organisation and types of perturbations. Only by doing so can we make progress in the quantification of stability in theory and in practice, and eventually build a more comprehensive understanding of how ecosystems will respond to ongoing environmental change.},

Chronosequences and associated space-for-time substitutions are an important and often necessary tool for studying temporal dynamics of plant communities and soil development across multiple time-scales. However, they are often used inappropriately, leading to false conclusions about ecological patterns and processes, which has prompted recent strong criticism of the approach. Here, we evaluate when chronosequences may or may not be appropriate for studying community and ecosystem development. 2. Chronosequences are appropriate to study plant succession at decadal to millennial time-scales when there is evidence that sites of different ages are following the same trajectory. They can also be reliably used to study aspects of soil development that occur between temporally linked sites over time-scales of centuries to millennia, sometimes independently of their application to shorter-term plant and soil biological communities. 3. Some characteristics of changing plant and soil biological communities (e.g. species richness, plant cover, vegetation structure, soil organic matter accumulation) are more likely to be related in a predictable and temporally linear manner than are other characteristics (e.g. species composition and abundance) and are therefore more reliably studied using a chronosequence approach. 4. Chronosequences are most appropriate for studying communities that are following convergent successional trajectories and have low biodiversity, rapid species turnover and low frequency and severity of disturbance. Chronosequences are least suitable for studying successional trajectories that are divergent, species-rich, highly disturbed or arrested in time because then there are often major difficulties in determining temporal linkages between stages. 5. Synthesis. We conclude that, when successional trajectories exceed the life span of investigators and the experimental and observational studies that they perform, temporal change can be successfully explored through the judicious use of chronosequences.},

	abstract = {Accurate predictions of future shifts in species diversity in response to global change are critical if useful conservation strategies are to be developed. The most widely used prediction method is to model individual species niches from point observations and project these models forward using future climate scenarios. The resulting changes in individual ranges are then summed to predict diversity changes; multiple models can be combined to produce ensemble forecasts. Predictions based on environment-richness regressions are rarer. However, richness regression models, based on macroecological diversity theory, have a long track record of making reliable spatial predictions of diversity patterns. If these empirical theories capture true functional relationships between environment and diversity, then they should make consistent predictions through time as well as space and could complement individual species-based predictions. Here, we use climate change throughout the 20th century to directly test the ability of these different approaches to predict shifts of Canadian butterfly diversity. We found that all approaches performed reasonably well, but the most accurate predictions were made using the single best richness-environment regression model, after accounting for the effects of spatial autocorrelation. Spatially trained regression models based on macroecological theory accurately predict diversity shifts for large species assemblages. Global changes provide pseudo-experimental tests of those macroecological theories that can then generate robust predictions of future conditions.},

Regional, spatial relationships between precipitation and richness could offer information about how altered rainfall will impact local communities, assuming that processes driving the regional relationship are also dominant at fine spatial and short temporal scales. To test this assumption, we compared spatial and temporal relationships between precipitation and both species richness and species turnover in central North American grasslands. Across a broad geographic gradient, mean plant species richness in 1-m2 plots increased significantly with mean annual precipitation. In contrast, over a 36-yr period at one mixed-grass prairie in the center of the regional gradient, single-year precipitation and richness were poorly correlated, and consecutive wet years had little effect on richness. Instead, richness increased most in wet years that followed dry years. Geographically dispersed sites receiving different levels of mean annual precipitation displayed strong differences in species composition, whereas temporal variation in precipitation at one site was not related to compositional dissimilarity, indicating that species turnover plays a key role in generating the regional relationship. Analyses of individual species’ presence-absence suggest that the lagged temporal responses reflect environmental germination cues more than resource competition. These complex cues may dampen the initial impact of altered precipitation on diversity, but over the long term, turnover in species composition should lead to changes in richness, as in the regional, spatial relationship. How quickly this long-term response develops may depend on the colonization rates of species better adapted to the altered rainfall regime.},

	abstract = {Many introductory ecology textbooks illustrate succession, at least in part, by using certain classic studies (e.g. sand dunes, ponds ⁄ bogs, glacial till, and old ﬁelds) that substituted space for time (chronosequence) in determining the sequences of the succession. Despite past criticisms of this method, there is continued, often uncritical, use of chronosequences in current research on topics besides succession, including temporal changes in biodiversity, productivity, nutrient cycling, etc. To show the problem with chronosequence-based studies in general, we review evidence from studies that used non-chronosequence methods (such as long-term study of permanent plots, palynology, and stand reconstruction) to test the space-for-time substitution in four classic succession studies. In several cases, the tests have used the same locations and, in one case, the same plots as those in the original studies. We show that empirical evidence invalidates the chronosequence-based sequences inferred in these classic studies.},

Phytoplankton production created the dominant reservoir of labile carbon driving BOD, and subsequent hypoxia, in a Piedmont river subject to algal blooms, three urban streams, a set of anthropogenically affected tidal creeks, and two urban lakes. Autotrophic phytoplankton production contributed to the BOD load in some rural streams. Autochthonous heterotrophic processes, stimulated primarily by phosphorus and secondarily by nitrogen loading, were the major inﬂuences on BOD in two large black water rivers and some rural black water streams. Inputs of biochemical oxygen-demanding materials from storm water runoff contribute to BOD in some urban and rural streams and black water rivers. We suggest that reductions of hypoxia can be better achieved by a system-speciﬁc approach based on an array of factors that potentially inﬂuence BOD, including both autochthonous and allochthonous variables. In some circumstances targeting the nutrient(s) stimulating phytoplankton blooms will sufﬁce to reduce hypoxia, but in other situations targeting nutrient(s) limiting bacterial production will be necessary. Reduction of non–point source inputs of biochemical oxygen-demanding materials derived from urbanization or other land disrupting activities will be critical in some cases.},

	abstract = {Investigating the mechanisms which underlie the biomass fluctuations of populations and communities is important to better understand the processes which buffer community biomass in a variable environment. Based on long-term data of plankton biomass in Lake Constance (Bodensee), this study aims at explaining the different degree of synchrony among populations observed within two freshwater plankton groups, phytoplankton and ciliates. Established measures of temporal variability such as the variance ratio and cross-correlation coefficients were combined with first-order autoregressive models that allow estimating species interactions from time-series data. We found that predation was an important driver of the observed seasonal variability patterns in phytoplankton and ciliates, and that competitive interactions only played a subordinate role. In Lake Constance copepods and cladocerans, two major invertebrate predator groups, focus their grazing pressure at different times of the season. Model results suggested that compensatory dynamics detected in phytoplankton originate from the differential vulnerability of species to either one of these two predator groups. For ciliates model results advocated that synchrony among species occurs because ciliates tend to be vulnerable to both predator groups. Our findings underline the necessity of extending studies of community variability to multiple trophic levels because accounting for predator-prey interactions may often be more important than accounting for competitive interactions at one trophic level.},

We then review the literature on the attributes of aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems to argue that empirical estimates of parameters governing energy ﬂux ﬁnd that aquatic ecosystems have higher rates of relative energy ﬂux than terrestrial ecosystems. Consistent with theory, we then review empirical work that shows aquatic ecosystems have greater herbivore : plant biomass ratios while we produce novel data to show that aquatic ecosystems have greater variability in population dynamics than their terrestrial counterparts. We end by arguing that theory, allometric relationships and a signiﬁcant, negative correlation between body size and population variability suggest that these results may be driven by the smaller average body sizes of aquatic organisms relative to terrestrial organisms.},

Theory predicts that prey species will ﬂuctuate in phase if predator–prey cycles are coupled through generalist predators, whereas they will ﬂuctuate in anti-phase if predator–prey cycles are coupled through competition between prey species. Here, we investigate predator–prey oscillations in a long-term experiment with a marine plankton community. Wavelet analysis of the species ﬂuctuations reveals two predator–prey cycles that ﬂuctuate largely in anti-phase. The phase angles point at strong competition between the phytoplankton species, but relatively little prey overlap among the zooplankton species. This food web architecture is consistent with the size structure of the plankton community, and generates highly dynamic food webs. Continued alternations in species dominance enable coexistence of the prey species through a non-equilibrium Ôkilling-the-winnerÕ mechanism, as the system shifts back and forth between the two predator–prey cycles in a chaotic fashion.},

Interestingly, CR coupling leads to in-phase synchrony of the oscillations, whereas RR coupling leads to antiphase synchrony. With either form of coupling, if the coupling remains weak, synchronous behavior is generated in the two systems.

Evidence suggests that high species diversity tends to increase plant community stability under interannual climate fluctuations and mild dry and wet events, but the overall pattern of diversity?stability relationships under climate extremes is unclear. We comprehensively review results from observational and experimental studies to assess the importance of diversity effects for ecosystem function under climate extremes. Both the broad literature review and a meta-analysis focused on the effects of extreme precipitation events on above-ground biomass reveal no significant interaction between species richness and climate extremes. Causes for variation in diversity effects under climate extremes are explored, from stress thresholds to biotic interactions and community assembly, and we consider how these may modulate the outcomes of biodiversity?stability relationships. We also examine how specific characteristics of climate extremes and timing of measurements may interact with mechanisms of diversity?stability relationships. Synthesis. Hypotheses tailored to the complexity of diversity effects, the implementation of standardised experiments and the use of trait-based biodiversity measures rather than species richness should lead to better causal understanding of whether and how biodiversity may protect ecosystems from adverse effects of climate extremes.},

Despite this long recognition of the coexistence of multiple interaction types in nature, little is known about the consequences of this diversity for community functioning. In the ongoing context of global change and increasing species extinction rates, it seems crucial to improve our understanding of the drivers of the relationship between species diversity and ecosystem functioning. Here, using a multispecies dynamical model of ecological communities including various interaction types (e.g. competition for space, predator interference, recruitment facilitation in addition to feeding), we studied the role of the presence and the intensity of these interactions for species diversity, community functioning (biomass and production) and the relationship between diversity and functioning.Taken jointly, the diverse interactions have significant effects on species diversity, whose amplitude and sign depend on the type of interactions involved and their relative abundance. They however consistently increase the slope of the relationship between diversity and functioning, suggesting that species losses might have stronger effects on community functioning than expected when ignoring the diversity of interaction types and focusing on feeding interactions only.},

	abstract = {Question Which functional diversity indices have the power to reveal changes in community assembly processes along abiotic stress gradients? Is their power affected by stochastic processes and variations in species richness along stress gradients? Methods We used a simple community assembly model to explore the power of functional diversity indices across a wide range of ecological contexts. The model assumes that with declining stress the influence of niche complementarity on species fitness increases while that of environmental filtering decreases. We separately incorporated two trait-independent stochastic processes – mass and priority effects – in simulating species occurrences and abundances along a hypothetical stress gradient. We ran simulations where species richness was constant along the gradient, or increased, decreased or varied randomly with declining stress. We compared observed values for two indices of functional richness – total functional dendrogram length (FD) and convex hull volume (FRic) – with a matrix-swap null model (yielding indices SESFD and SESFRic) to remove any trivial effects of species richness. We also compared two indices that measure both functional richness and functional divergence – Rao quadratic entropy (Rao) and functional dispersion (FDis) – with a null model that randomizes abundances across species but within communities. This converts them to pure measures of functional divergence (SESRao and SESFDis). Results When mass effects operated, only SESRao and SESFDis gave reasonable power, irrespective of how species richness varied along the stress gradient. FD, FRic, Rao and FDis had low power when species richness was constant, and variation in species richness greatly influenced their power. SESFRic and SESFD were unaffected by variation in species richness. When priority effects operated, FRic, SESFRic, Rao and FDis had good power and were unaffected by variation in species richness. Variation in species richness greatly affected FD and SESFD. SESRao and SESFDis had low power in the priority effects model but were unaffected by variation in species richness. Conclusions Our results demonstrate that a reliable test for changes in assembly processes along stress gradients requires functional diversity indices measuring either functional richness or functional divergence. We recommend using SESFRic as a measure of functional richness and either SESRao or SESFDis (which are very closely related mathematically) as a measure of functional divergence. Used together, these indices of functional richness and functional divergence provide good power to test for increasing niche complementarity with declining stress across a broad range of ecological contexts.},

	abstract = {Recently, a debate has developed over how biodiversity is changing across the planet. While most researchers agree species extinctions are increasing globally due to human activity, some now argue that species richness at local scales is not declining as many biologists have claimed. This argument stems from recent syntheses of timeseries data that suggest species richness is decreasing in some locations, increasing in others, but not changing on average. Critics of these syntheses (like us) have argued there are serious limitations of existing time-series datasets and their analyses that preclude meaningful conclusions about local biodiversity change. Speciﬁcally, authors of these syntheses have failed to account for several primary drivers of biodiversity change, have relied on data poor time-series that lack baselines needed to detect change, and have unreasonably extrapolated conclusions. Here we summarize the history of this debate, as well as key papers and exchanges that have helped clarify new issues and ideas. To resolve the debate, we suggest future researchers be more clear about the hypotheses of biodiversity change being tested, focus less on amassing large datasets, and more on amassing high-quality datasets that provide unambiguous tests of the hypotheses. Researchers should also keep track of the contributions that native versus non-native species make to biodiversity time trends, as these have diﬀerent implications for conservation. Lastly, we suggest researchers be aware of pros and cons of using diﬀerent types of data (e.g., time-series, spatial comparisons), taking care to resolve divergent results among sources to allow broader conclusions about biodiversity change.},

	abstract = {Abstract Energy, nutrients and organisms move over landscapes, connecting ecosystems across space and time. Meta-ecosystem theory investigates the emerging properties of local ecosystems coupled spatially by these movements of organisms and matter, by explicitly tracking exchanges of multiple substances across ecosystem borders. To date, meta-ecosystem research has focused mostly on abiotic flows—neglecting biotic nutrient flows. However, recent work has indicated animals act as spatial nutrient vectors when they transport nutrients across landscapes in the form of excreta, egesta and their own bodies. Partly due to its high level of abstraction, there are few empirical tests of meta-ecosystem theory. Furthermore, while animals may be viewed as important mediators of ecosystem functions, better integration of tools is needed to develop predictive insights of their relative roles and impacts on diverse ecosystems. We present a methodological roadmap that explains how to do such integration by discussing how to combine insights from movement, foraging and ecosystem ecology to develop a coherent understanding of animal-vectored nutrient transport on meta-ecosystems processes. We discuss how the slate of newly developed technologies and methods—tracking devices, mechanistic movement models, diet reconstruction techniques and remote sensing—that when integrated have the potential to advance the quantification of animal-vectored nutrient flows and increase the predictive power of meta-ecosystem theory. We demonstrate that by integrating novel and established tools of animal ecology, ecosystem ecology and remote sensing, we can begin to identify and quantify animal-mediated nutrient translocation by large animals. We also provide conceptual examples that show how our proposed integration of methodologies can help investigate ecosystem impacts of large animal movement. We conclude by describing practical advancements to understanding cross-ecosystem contributions of animals on the move. Understanding the mechanisms by which animals shape ecosystem dynamics is important for ongoing conservation, rewilding and restoration initiatives around the world, and for developing more accurate models of ecosystem nutrient budgets. Our roadmap will enable ecologists to better qualify and quantify animal-mediated nutrient translocation for animals on the move.},

To evaluate potential responses of anadromous fish populations to an increasingly variable environment, we performed a hierarchical analysis of 21 Chinook salmon populations from the Pacific Northwest, examining support for changes in river flows and flow variability on population growth. More than half of the rivers analyzed have already experienced significant increases in flow variability over the last 60 years, and this study shows that this increase in variability in freshwater flows has a more negative effect than any other climate signal included in our model. Climate change models predict that this region will experience warmer winters and more variable flows, which may limit the ability of these populations to recover.},

	abstract = {Life-history strategies can buffer individuals and populations from environmental variability. For instance, it is possible that asynchronous dynamics among different life histories can stabilize populations through portfolio effects. Here, we examine life-history diversity and its importance to stability for an iconic migratory fish species. In particular, we examined steelhead (Oncorhynchus mykiss), an anadromous and iteroparous salmonid, in two large, relatively pristine, watersheds, the Skeena and Nass, in north-western British Columbia, Canada. We synthesized life-history information derived from scales collected from adult steelhead (N = 7227) in these watersheds across a decade. These migratory fishes expressed 36 different manifestations of the anadromous life-history strategy, with 16 different combinations of freshwater and marine ages, 7·6\% of fish performing multiple spawning migrations, and up to a maximum of four spawning migrations per lifetime. Furthermore, in the Nass watershed, various life histories were differently prevalent through time – three different life histories were the most prevalent in a given year, and no life history ever represented more than 45\% of the population. These asynchronous dynamics among life histories decreased the variability of numerical abundance and biomass of the aggregated population so that it was {\textgreater} 20\% more stable than the stability of the weighted average of specific life histories: evidence of a substantial portfolio effect. Year of ocean entry was a key driver of dynamics; the median correlation coefficient of abundance of life histories that entered the ocean the same year was 2·5 times higher than the median pairwise coefficient of life histories that entered the ocean at different times. Simulations illustrated how different elements of life-history diversity contribute to stability and persistence of populations. This study provides evidence that life-history diversity can dampen fluctuations in population abundances and biomass via portfolio effects. Conserving genetic integrity and habitat diversity in these and other large watersheds can enable a diversity of life histories that increases population and biomass stability in the face of environmental variability.},

How local ecological assemblages are responding is less clear—a concern given their importance for many ecosystem functions and services. We analysed a terrestrial assemblage database of unprecedented geographic and taxonomic coverage to quantify local biodiversity responses to land use and related changes. Here we show that in the worst-affected habitats, these pressures reduce within-sample species richness by an average of 76.5\%, total abundance by 39.5\% and rarefaction-based richness by 40.3\%. We estimate that, globally, these pressures have already slightly reduced average within-sample richness (by 13.6\%), total abundance (10.7\%) and rarefaction-based richness (8.1\%), with changes showing marked spatial variation. Rapid further losses are predicted under a business-as-usual land-use scenario; within-sample richness is projected to fall by a further 3.4\% globally by 2100, with losses concentrated in biodiverse but economically poor countries. Strong mitigation can deliver much more positive biodiversity changes (up to a 1.9\% average increase) that are less strongly related to countries' socioeconomic status.},

We analyzed 100 time series from biomes across Earth to ask how diversity within assemblages is changing through time. We quantified patterns of temporal α diversity, measured as change in local diversity, and temporal β diversity, measured as change in community composition. Contrary to our expectations, we did not detect systematic loss of α diversity. However, community composition changed systematically through time, in excess of predictions from null models. Heterogeneous rates of environmental change, species range shifts associated with climate change, and biotic homogenization may explain the different patterns of temporal α and β diversity. Monitoring and understanding change in species composition should be a conservation priority.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Such spatially and temporally extensive datasets have been lacking for freshwater systems in comparison to terrestrial ones. Main types of variables contained The database includes 11,386 time-series of riverine fish community catch data, including 646,270 species-specific abundance records, together with metadata related to the geographical location and sampling methodology of each time-series. Spatial location and grain The database contains 11,072 unique sampling locations (stream reach), spanning 19 countries, five biogeographical realms and 402 hydrographical basins world-wide. Time period and grain The database encompasses the period 1951–2019. Each time-series is composed of a minimum of two yearly surveys (mean = 8 years) and represents a minimum time span of 10 years (mean = 19 years). Major taxa and level of measurement The database includes 944 species of ray-finned fishes (Class Actinopterygii). Software format csv. Main conclusion Our collective effort provides the most comprehensive long-term community database of riverine fishes to date. This unique database should interest ecologists who seek to understand the impacts of human activities on riverine fish biodiversity and to model and predict how fish communities will respond to future environmental change. Together, we hope it will promote advances in macroecological research in the freshwater realm.},

Yet, our understanding of how network topology influences metapopulation synchrony in these ecosystems remains limited. Here, we introduce the concept of fluvial synchrogram to formulate and test expectations regarding the geography of metapopulation synchrony across watersheds. By combining theoretical simulations and an extensive fish population time-series dataset across Europe, we provide evidence that fish metapopulations can be buffered against synchronous dynamics as a direct consequence of network connectivity and branching complexity. Synchrony was higher between populations connected by direct water flow and decayed faster with distance over the Euclidean than the watercourse dimension. Likewise, synchrony decayed faster with distance in headwater than mainstem populations of the same basin. As network topology and flow directionality generate fundamental spatial patterns of synchrony in fish metapopulations, empirical synchrograms can aid knowledge advancement and inform conservation strategies in complex habitats.},

Time period 1992–2012. Major taxa studied Stream fishes. Methods We analysed the relationship between biodiversity (species richness and functional diversity) and fish community biomass at 1,357 stream sites distributed throughout France. We used piecewise path analysis to quantify effects of abiotic and biodiversity variables on biomass and assess relative contributions of native and non-native species on the diversity–biomass relationship. Results Biodiversity showed a direct positive relationship with biomass after controlling for sampling effort, and direct effects of biodiversity variables on community biomass exceeded those of climate and physical habitat variables. Our analysis indicates that positive effects of species richness on biomass exceeded those of functional diversity. Indirect effects of abiotic variables mediated by biodiversity metrics indicated that biomass increased in warmer, lowland habitats. Human impact had no effect on native biodiversity but had a positive effect on non-native biodiversity. Main conclusions We provide evidence that direct effects of biodiversity on community biomass outweigh those of abiotic variables in riverine fish communities, but resource partitioning alone is unlikely to drive the effects of biodiversity on biomass in this system. Quantification of the relative roles of anthropogenic impacts, biodiversity and environmental context in the regulation of ecosystem functioning will be necessary to understand the potential consequences of ongoing global change.},

	abstract = {Aim River flow regimes are changing globally as a consequence of human use of freshwater resources. Additionally, rivers are among the most invaded ecosystems. Invasion biology predicts that the establishment and spread of non-native species might be favoured both by new environmental regimes (niche opportunities) and by human-mediated dispersal (propagule pressure). Here, we expand on past research by asking whether these two mechanisms act in isolation or whether they interact to facilitate the spread of non-natives. Location Conterminous USA. Time period 1987–2016. Major taxa studied Freshwater fishes. Methods First, we examined the geography of riverine fish invasions across 1,148 watersheds spanning the conterminous USA. We focused on species richness and the life-history strategies of non-native (both translocated and exotic) relative to native species pools. Second, we quantified flow regime alteration as the deviation between observed and expected contemporary flow regimes, using a combination of spectral analyses on long-term discharge data and random forest models. We focused on two biologically relevant facets of the flow regime: flow variability and flow seasonality. We also estimated metrics of propagule pressure: recreational fishing pressure and socioeconomic activity. We then compared the strength of evidence associating riverine fish invasions with flow alteration, propagule pressure, and interactions between the two mechanisms. Results We found that alteration of flow variability and seasonality is widespread across the conterminous U.S. rivers, and has favoured invasions by filtering specific life-history strategies. Importantly, high levels of flow stabilization and propagule pressure interacted: where co-occurring, these two drivers were associated with higher fish invadedness levels than expected based on their individual effects. Main conclusions Our results underscore the need to consider different drivers of invasion concurrently. Otherwise, important synergistic interactions might be missed that could explain (and guide management strategies to mitigate) the high levels of invasion in fresh waters.},

Emerging research points to an interdependency of dispersal with a diverse suite of traits in terrestrial organisms, however the extent to which such dispersal syndromes exist in freshwater species remains uncertain. Here, we test whether dispersal in freshwater fishes (1) is a fixed property of species, and (2) correlates with life-history, morphological, ecological and behavioural traits, using a global dataset of dispersal distances collected from the literature encompassing 116 riverine species and 196 locations. Our meta-analysis revealed a high degree of repeatability and heritability in the dispersal estimates and strong associations with traits related to life-history strategies, energy allocation to reproduction, ecological specialization and swimming skills. Together, these results demonstrate that similar to terrestrial organisms, the multi-dimensional nature of dispersal syndromes in freshwater species offer opportunities for the development of a unifying paradigm of movement ecology that transcend taxonomic and biogeographical realms. The high explanatory power of the models also suggests that trait-based and phylogenetic approaches hold considerable promises to inform conservation efforts in a rapidly changing world.},

	abstract = {Species responses to climate change have been shown to vary in both direction and magnitude. Understanding these idiosyncratic responses is crucial if we are to predict extinction risk and set up efficient conservation strategies. The variations observed across species have been related to several species attributes including intrinsic traits such as physiological tolerances or life-history strategies but also to niche characteristics (e.g., niche breadth [NB], niche position [NP]). However, although previous studies have successfully linked species attributes to population dynamics or range shifts, few have considered synergistic effects to explain responses to climate variations. Here, we assessed whether five species attributes (fecundity, thermal safety margin, trophic position [TP], NB, and NP) explained interspecific differences in four parameters influencing population dynamics of 35 stream fish species at the French scale. We used Bayesian N-mixture models to estimate posterior distributions of the growth rate, the strength of density dependence, and the influence of both mean temperature and temperature variability on populations for each species. We then used phylogenetic generalized least squares (PGLS) models to investigate the influence of species attributes and their interactions on interspecific differences in each of the four parameter driving population dynamics. The percentage of variance explained by the PGLS models was relatively high (around 40\% on average), indicating that species attributes are good predictors of species population dynamics. Furthermore, we showed that the influence of these single attributes was mediated by other attributes, especially NP and TP. Importantly, we found that models including interaction terms had greater support over simple additive models in explaining interspecific differences in population dynamics. Taken together, these results point to the importance of considering the interplay between species attributes in unraveling the mechanisms involved in population dynamics and understanding the vulnerability of species to global change.},

Although freshwater ecosystems include some of the most imperilled fauna worldwide, such range shifts have been poorly documented in streams and rivers and have never been compared to the current velocity of climate change. Based on national monitoring data, we examined the distributional changes of 32 stream fish species in France and quantified potential time lags in species responses, providing a unique opportunity to analyze range shifts over recent decades of warming in freshwater environments. A multi-facetted approach, based on several range measures along spatial gradients, allowed us to quantify range shifts of numerous species across the whole hydrographic network between an initial period (1980–1992) and a contemporary one (2003–2009), and to contrast them to the rates of isotherm shift in elevation and stream distance. Our results highlight systematic species shifts towards higher elevation and upstream, with mean shifts in range centre of 13.7 m decade−1 and 0.6 km decade−1, respectively. Fish species displayed dispersal-driven expansions along the altitudinal gradient at their upper range limit (61.5 m decade−1), while substantial range contractions at the lower limit (6.3 km decade−1) were documented for most species along the upstream–downstream gradient. Despite being consistent with the geographic variation in climate change velocities, these patterns reveal that the majority of stream fish have not shifted at a pace sufficient to track changing climate, in particular at their range centre where range shifts lag far behind expectation. Our study provides evidence that stream fish are currently responding to recent climate warming at a greater rate than many terrestrial organisms, although not as much as needed to cope with future climate modifications.},

We compiled data from 166 long-term surveys of insect assemblages across 1676 sites to investigate trends in insect abundances over time. Overall, we found considerable variation in trends even among adjacent sites but an average decline of terrestrial insect abundance by {\textasciitilde}9\% per decade and an increase of freshwater insect abundance by {\textasciitilde}11\% per decade. Both patterns were largely driven by strong trends in North America and some European regions. We found some associations with potential drivers (e.g., land-use drivers), and trends in protected areas tended to be weaker.

Here, we introduce BioShifts—a global geo-database of 30,534 range shifts. Despite a spatial imbalance towards the most developed regions of the Northern Hemisphere and a taxonomic bias towards the most charismatic animals and plants of the planet, data show that marine species are better at tracking isotherm shifts, and move towards the pole six times faster than terrestrial species. More specifically, we find that marine species closely track shifting isotherms in warm and relatively undisturbed waters (for example, the Central Pacific Basin) or in cold waters subject to high human pressures (for example, the North Sea). On land, human activities impede the capacity of terrestrial species to track isotherm shifts in latitude, with some species shifting in the opposite direction to isotherms. Along elevational gradients, species follow the direction of isotherm shifts but at a pace that is much slower than expected, especially in areas with warm climates. Our results suggest that terrestrial species are lagging behind shifting isotherms more than marine species, which is probably related to the interplay between the wider thermal safety margin of terrestrial versus marine species and the more constrained physical environment for dispersal in terrestrial versus marine habitats.},

	abstract = {It is predicted that warmer conditions should lead to a loss of trophic levels, as larger bodied consumers, which occupy higher trophic levels, experience higher metabolic costs at high temperature. Yet, it is unclear whether this prediction is consistent with the effect of warming on the trophic structure of natural systems. Furthermore, effects of temperature at the species level, which arise through a change in species composition, may differ from those at the population level, which arise through a change in population structure. We investigate this by building species-level trophic networks, and size-structured trophic networks, as a proxy for population structure, for 18 648 stream fish communities, from 4 145 234 individual fish samples, across 7024 stream locations in France from 1980 to 2008. We estimated effects of temperature on total trophic diversity (total number of nodes), vertical trophic diversity (mean and maximum trophic level) and distribution of biomass across trophic level (correlation between trophic level and biomass) in these networks. We found a positive effect of temperature on total trophic diversity in both species- and size-structured trophic networks. We found that maximum trophic level and biomass distribution decreased in species-level and size-structured trophic networks, but the mean trophic level decreased only in size-structured trophic networks. These results show that warmer temperatures associate with a lower vertical trophic diversity in size-structured networks, and a higher one in species-level networks. This suggests that vertical trophic diversity is shaped by antagonistic effects of temperature on population structure and on species composition. Our results hence demonstrate that effects of temperature do not only differ across trophic levels, but also across levels of biological organisation, from population to species level, implying complex changes in network structure and functioning with warming.},

We experimentally varied evenness of four grassland species (three grasses and one forb) by planting a field experiment in Texas, and monitored the number of unplanted dicot and monocot species that invaded plots for two growing seasons. By varying evenness, we eliminated any sampling effect in our diversity treatment, because all plots contained the same plant species. Experimentally reducing evenness led to a greater number of dicot invaders, which emerged in plots throughout the growing season, but had less of an effect on monocot invaders, which emerged in flushes when experimental plants were semi-dormant. Frequency of Solidago canadensis (altissima) stems with spittle bugs significantly increased with reductions in evenness during the first year, apparently because the greater number of Solidago stems in high evenness plots diluted the spittle-bug effect. These results support the view that higher diversity plant communities are more resistant to dicot invaders and insect herbivores.},

We experimentally varied species evenness and the identity of the dominant plant species in an old field of Quebec to test whether plant productivity would increase with increasing levels of evenness, and whether relationships would be invariant with respect to species identity. Total and belowground biomass increased linearly with increasing levels of evenness after one growing season. These relationships did not depend on the identity of the dominant species. Relationships between aboveground biomass and evenness varied and depended on the identity of the dominant. Our results are largely consistent with the idea that human-influenced reductions in small-scale plant diversity, in this case evenness, will lead to indirect reductions in total primary productivity. Furthermore, because the evenness treatments were not confounded with species identity, our results suggest that diversity has an effect on plant productivity above and beyond the sampling effect (having a higher probability of species with higher growth rates in diverse communities) seen in studies that vary species richness.},

	abstract = {As climate change unfolds, changes in population dynamics and species distribution ranges are expected to fundamentally reshuffle communities worldwide. Yet, a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms and extent of community reorganization remains elusive. This is particularly true in riverine systems, which are simultaneously exposed to changing temperature and streamflow, and where land-use change continues to be a major driver of biodiversity loss. Here, we use the most comprehensive compilation of fish abundance time series to date to provide a global synthesis of climate- and LU-induced effects on riverine biota with respect to changes in species thermal and streamflow affinities. We demonstrate that fish communities are increasingly dominated by thermophilic (warm-water) and limnophilic (slow-water) species. Despite being consistent with trends in water temperature and streamflow observed over recent decades, these community changes appear largely decoupled from each other and show wide spatial variation. We further reveal a synergy among climate- and land use-related drivers, such that community thermophilization is heightened in more human-modified systems. Importantly, communities in which species experience thermal and flow regimes that approach or exceed their tolerance thresholds (high community sensitivity), as well as species-poor communities (low community resilience), also display faster rates of compositional change. This research illustrates that quantifying vulnerability of riverine systems to climate change requires a broadening from a narrower thermal focus to more integrative approaches that account for the spatially varying and multifaceted sensitivity of riverine organisms to the interactive effects of water temperature, hydrology, and other anthropogenic changes.},

	abstract = {Synchrony among population fluctuations of multiple coexisting species has a major impact on community stability, i.e. on the relative temporal constancy of aggregate properties such as total community biomass. However, synchrony and its impacts are usually measured using covariance methods, which do not account for whether species abundances may be more correlated when species are relatively common than when they are scarce, or vice versa. Recent work showed that species commonly exhibit such ‘asymmetric tail associations’. We here consider the influence of asymmetric tail associations on community stability. We develop a ‘skewness ratio’ which quantifies how much species relationships and tail associations modify stability. The skewness ratio complements the classic variance ratio and related metrics. Using multi-decadal grassland datasets, we show that accounting for tail associations gives new viewpoints on synchrony and stability; e.g. species associations can alter community stability differentially for community crashes or explosions to high values, a fact not previously detectable. Species associations can mitigate explosions of community abundance to high values, increasing one aspect of stability, while simultaneously exacerbating crashes to low values, decreasing another aspect of stability; or vice versa. Our work initiates a new, more flexible paradigm for exploring species relationships and community stability.

            Ensuring reliable supply of services from nature is key to the sustainable development and well-being of human societies. Varied and frequently complex relationships between biodiversity and ecosystem services have, however, frustrated our capacity to quantify and predict the vulnerability of those services to species extinctions. Here, we use a qualitative Boolean modelling framework to identify universal drivers of the robustness of ecosystem service supply to species loss. These drivers comprise simple features of the networks that link species to the functions they perform that, in turn, underpin a service. Together, they define what we call network fragility. Using data from {\textgreater}250 real ecological networks representing services such as pollination and seed-dispersal, we demonstrate that network fragility predicts remarkably well the robustness of empirical ecosystem services. We then show how to quantify contributions of individual species to ecosystem service robustness, enabling quantification of how vulnerability scales from species to services. Our findings provide general insights into the way species, functional traits, and the links between them together determine the vulnerability of ecosystem service supply to biodiversity loss.},

	abstract = {Climate change affects ecological communities through its impact on the physiological performance of individuals. However, the population dynamic of species well inside their thermal niche is also determined by competitors, prey and predators, in addition to being influenced by temperature changes. We use a trait-based food-web model to examine how the interplay between the direct physiological effects from temperature and the indirect effects due to changing interactions between populations shapes the ecological consequences of climate change for populations and for entire communities. Our simulations illustrate how isolated communities deteriorate as populations go extinct when the environment moves outside the species' thermal niches. High-trophic-level species are most vulnerable, while the ecosystem function of lower trophic levels is less impacted. Open communities can compensate for the loss of ecosystem function by invasions of new species. Individual populations show complex responses largely uncorrelated with the direct impact of temperature change on physiology. Such complex responses are particularly evident during extinction and invasion events of other species, where climatically well-adapted species may be brought to extinction by the changed food-web topology. Our results highlight that the impact of climate change on specific populations is largely unpredictable, and apparently well-adapted species may be severely impacted.},

	abstract = {Global warming and ocean acidification are forecast to exert significant impacts on marine ecosystems worldwide. However, most of these projections are based on ecological proxies or experiments on single species or simplified food webs. How energy fluxes are likely to change in marine food webs in response to future climates remains unclear, hampering forecasts of ecosystem functioning. Using a sophisticated mesocosm experiment, we model energy flows through a species-rich multilevel food web, with live habitats, natural abiotic variability, and the potential for intra- and intergenerational adaptation. We show experimentally that the combined stress of acidification and warming reduced energy flows from the first trophic level (primary producers and detritus) to the second (herbivores), and from the second to the third trophic level (carnivores). Warming in isolation also reduced the energy flow from herbivores to carnivores, the efficiency of energy transfer from primary producers and detritus to herbivores and detritivores, and the living biomass of detritivores, herbivores, and carnivores. Whilst warming and acidification jointly boosted primary producer biomass through an expansion of cyanobacteria, this biomass was converted to detritus rather than to biomass at higher trophic levels—i.e., production was constrained to the base of the food web. In contrast, ocean acidification affected the food web positively by enhancing trophic flow from detritus and primary producers to herbivores, and by increasing the biomass of carnivores. Our results show how future climate change can potentially weaken marine food webs through reduced energy flow to higher trophic levels and a shift towards a more detritus-based system, leading to food web simplification and altered producer–consumer dynamics, both of which have important implications for the structuring of benthic communities.},

Understanding these impacts is therefore essential for managing ecosystems and sustaining human well-being. Here, we conducted a global synthesis of terrestrial, marine, and freshwater studies to identify key gaps in our knowledge of climate change impacts on food webs and determine whether the areas currently studied are those most likely to be impacted by climate change. We found research suffers from a strong geographic bias, with only 3.5\% of studies occurring in the tropics. Importantly, the distribution of sites sampled under projected climate changes was biased—areas with decreases or large increases in precipitation and areas with low magnitudes of temperature change were under-represented. Our results suggest that understanding of climate change impacts on food webs could be broadened by considering more than two trophic levels, responses in addition to species abundance and biomass, impacts of a wider suite of climatic variables, and tropical ecosystems. Most importantly, to enable better forecasts of biodiversity responses to climate change, we identify critically under-represented geographic regions and climatic conditions which should be prioritized in future research.},

	abstract = {Studying how food web structure and function vary through time represents an opportunity to better comprehend and anticipate ecosystem changes. Yet, temporal studies of highly resolved food web structure are scarce. With few exceptions, most temporal food web studies are either too simplified, preventing a detailed assessment of structural properties or binary, missing the temporal dynamics of energy fluxes among species. Using long-term, multi-trophic biomass data coupled with highly resolved information on species feeding relationships, we analysed food web dynamics in the Gulf of Riga (Baltic Sea) over more than three decades (1981–2014). We combined unweighted (topology-based) and weighted (biomass- and flux-based) food web approaches, first, to unravel how distinct descriptors can highlight differences (or similarities) in food web dynamics through time, and second, to compare temporal dynamics of food web structure and function. We find that food web descriptors vary substantially and distinctively through time, likely reflecting different underlying ecosystem processes. While node- and link-weighted metrics reflect changes related to alterations in species dominance and fluxes, unweighted metrics are more sensitive to changes in species and link richness. Comparing unweighted, topology-based metrics and flux-based functions further indicates that temporal changes in functions cannot be predicted using unweighted food web structure. Rather, information on species population dynamics and weighted, flux-based networks should be included to better comprehend temporal food web dynamics. By integrating unweighted, node- and link-weighted metrics, we here demonstrate how different approaches can be used to compare food web structure and function, and identify complementary patterns of change in temporal food web dynamics, which enables a more complete understanding of the ecological processes at play in ecosystems undergoing change.},

Yet, a lingering paradigm among natural scientists, conservationists, and policymakers is that human transformation of terrestrial nature is mostly recent and inherently destructive. Here, we use the most up-to-date, spatially explicit global reconstruction of historical human populations and land use to show that this paradigm is likely wrong. Even 12,000 y ago, nearly three quarters of Earth’s land was inhabited and therefore shaped by human societies, including more than 95\% of temperate and 90\% of tropical woodlands. Lands now characterized as “natural,” “intact,” and “wild” generally exhibit long histories of use, as do protected areas and Indigenous lands, and current global patterns of vertebrate species richness and key biodiversity areas are more strongly associated with past patterns of land use than with present ones in regional landscapes now characterized as natural. The current biodiversity crisis can seldom be explained by the loss of uninhabited wildlands, resulting instead from the appropriation, colonization, and intensifying use of the biodiverse cultural landscapes long shaped and sustained by prior societies. Recognizing this deep cultural connection with biodiversity will therefore be essential to resolve the crisis.},

We developed a BEF theory based on mechanistic population dynamic models, which allows the inclusion of the effect of temperature. Using experimentally established relationships between attack rate and temperature, the model predicts that temperature increase will intensify competition, and consequently the BEF relationship will ﬂatten or even become negative. We conducted a laboratory experiment with natural microbial microcosms, and the results were in agreement with the model predictions. The experimental results also revealed that an increase in both temperature average and variation had a more intense effect than an increase in temperature average alone.

We show the generality of our explanation with another 21 observed food webs, comparing random-type parameterisations of interaction strengths with empirical ones.

We use bird captures spanning {\textgreater} 35 years from 55 sites within a vast area of intact Amazonian rainforest to reveal reduced abundance of terrestrial and near-ground insectivores in the absence of deforestation, edge effects or other direct anthropogenic landscape change. Because undisturbed forest includes far fewer terrestrial and near-ground insectivores than it did historically, today’s fragments and second growth are more impoverished than shown by comparisons with modern ‘control’ sites. Any goals for bird community recovery in Amazonian second growth should recognise that a modern bird community will inevitably differ from a baseline from {\textgreater} 35 years ago. Abundance patterns driven by landscape change may be the most conspicuous manifestation of human activity, but biodiversity declines in undisturbed forest represent hidden losses, possibly driven by climate change, that may be pervasive in intact Amazonian forests and other systems considered to be undisturbed.},

In this paper, we describe a non-random resampling method to directly address the temporal aspects of scaling ecological observations by leveraging existing data. Findings from long-term research sites have been hugely influential in ecology because of their unprecedented longitu­ dinal perspective, yet short-term studies more consistent with typical grant cycles and graduate programs are still the norm. We use long-term insights to create ‘broken windows,’ that is, reanalyze long-term studies from shortterm observational perspectives to examine discontinuities in trends at differing temporal scales.},

	abstract = {Niche Theory is a central framework in ecology based on the recognition that most interactions between organisms are indirect, mediated by the biotic and abiotic dynamical environment these organisms live in. Despite its potential generality, the theory still mostly focuses on how resource–consumer dynamics mediate competition in ecological communities. However, it is being increasingly recognized that positive interactions between organisms also play an important role in driving the structure and functioning of ecological communities, from plants to microbes. In this paper, we present a unified theory of the niche that applies to both positive and negative interactions between organisms, mediated by one or two environmental factors. We show that classical concepts such as niche differences and fundamental and realized niches can naturally be expanded to facilitative and mutualistic interactions. In addition, we introduce and formalize new general niche concepts that appear exclusively in the presence of positive interactions: (1) the Allee niche, a region of environmental conditions for which a species can persist but not invade from low densities and (2) niche facilitation, when the presence of a species expands the set of environmental conditions under which a second species can invade and/or persist. To show the broad applicability of this theory, we illustrate these concepts using a diverse set of theoretical examples, from bacteria feeding on an inhibiting substrate, to nitrogen-fixing plants and the indirect mutualism between a plant and a carnivore species. In sum, our work shows how Niche Theory provides a natural framework for positive interactions in ecology, bringing a unified perspective and new conceptual tools to study ecological systems where these positive interactions occur.},

	abstract = {Plants present a variety of defensive strategies against herbivores, broadly classiﬁed into tolerance and resistance. Since resource availability can also limit plant growth, we expect plant allocation to resource acquisition and defense to vary along resource gradients. Yet, the conditions under which one defensive strategy is favored over the other are unclear. Here, we use an eco-evolutionary model to investigate plant adaptive allocation to resource acquisition, tolerance, and resistance along a resource gradient in a simple food web module inspired by plankton communities where plants compete for a single resource and are grazed on by a shared herbivore. We show that undefended, acquisition-specialist strategies dominate under low resource supplies. Conversely, high resource supplies, which lead to high herbivore abundance because of trophic transfers, result in either the dominance of very resistant strategies or coexistence between a completely resistant strategy and a fast-growing, tolerant one. We also explore the consequences of this adaptive allocation on species biomasses. Finally, we compare our predictions to a more traditional, density-independent optimization model. We show that density dependence mediated by resources and herbivores is the cause of the increase in plant resistance along the resource gradient, as the optimization model would instead have favored tolerance.},

This leads to the possibility of indirect interactions among those victims, both positive and negative. The term apparent competition commonly denotes negative indirect interactions between victim species that arise because they share a natural enemy. This indirect interaction, which in principle can be reﬂected in many facets of the distribution and abundance of individual species and more broadly govern the structure of ecological communities in time and space, pervades many natural ecosystems. It also is a central theme in many applied ecological problems, including the control of agricultural pests, harvesting, the conservation of endangered species, and the dynamics of emerging diseases. At one end of the scale of life, apparent competition characterizes intriguing aspects of dynamics within individual organisms—for example, the immune system is akin in many ways to a predator that can induce negative indirect interactions among different pathogens. At intermediate scales of biological organization, the existence and strength of apparent competition depend upon many contingent details of individual behavior and life history, as well as the community and spatial context within which indirect interactions play out. At the broadest scale of macroecology and macroevolution, apparent competition may play a major, if poorly understood, role in the evolution of species’ geographical ranges and adaptive radiations.},

	abstract = {Biotic interactions are often ignored in assessments of climate change impacts. However, climate-related changes in species interactions, often mediated through increased dominance of certain species or functional groups, may have important implications for how species respond to climate warming and altered precipitation patterns. We examined how a dominant plant functional group affected the population dynamics of four co-occurring forb species by experimentally removing graminoids in seminatural grasslands. Specifically, we explored how the interaction between dominants and subordinates varied with climate by replicating the removal experiment across a climate grid consisting of 12 field sites spanning broad-scale temperature and precipitation gradients in southern Norway. Biotic interactions affected population growth rates of all study species, and the net outcome of interactions between dominants and subordinates switched from facilitation to competition with increasing temperature along the temperature gradient. The impacts of competitive interactions on subordinates in the warmer sites could primarily be attributed to reduced plant survival. Whereas the response to dominant removal varied with temperature, there was no overall effect of precipitation on the balance between competition and facilitation. Our findings suggest that global warming may increase the relative importance of competitive interactions in seminatural grasslands across a wide range of precipitation levels, thereby favouring highly competitive dominant species over subordinate species. As a result, seminatural grasslands may become increasingly dependent on disturbance (i.e. traditional management such as grazing and mowing) to maintain viable populations of subordinate species and thereby biodiversity under future climates. Our study highlights the importance of population-level studies replicated under different climatic conditions for understanding the underlying mechanisms of climate change impacts on plants.},

	abstract = {Questions: What are the nurse effects of Rhodomyrtus tomentosa in degraded land of South China? Are canopy or soil factors responsible for the main nurse effect? Do facilitative effects increase with the shade tolerance of the target species? Location: Degraded shrubland in South China. Methods: Seedlings of three native climax woody species (Schima superba, Michelia macclurei, Castanopsis fissa) that differ in shade tolerance were subjected to four treatments by transplantation: (1) under the canopy of R. tomentosa shrubs; (2) in open interspaces without vegetation cover (control); (3) under the canopy of R. tomentosa from which canopies had been removed; and (4) in open interspaces without vegetation but covered by branches and leaves of R. tomentosa. Results: At low soil nutrient levels, increased canopy shade, soil porosity and soil moisture under the canopy of R. tomentosa increased seedling survival of the climax tree species S. superba, C. fissa and M. macclurei, and shoot height of S. superba. The nurse effect (a form of facilitation) of R. tomentosa depended more on canopy shade than on soil amelioration. The magnitude of facilitation or nurse effect was positively correlated with shade tolerance of the target species. Conclusions: Use of nurse plants in restoration differs from traditional reforestation (clearing and/or burning to reduce interspecific competition between target tree species and non-target species) because it focuses on positive interactions between nurse plants and target plants that increase establishment of target species and reduce time required for restoration. Because nurse effects of R. tomentosa shrubs tended to be larger on target species with greater shade tolerance, shade-tolerant plants are suggested as target species to accelerate restoration.},

In the past decades, much effort has been devoted to infer the importance of a particular structure by its capacity to tolerate an external perturbation on its structure or dynamics. Here, we demonstrate that such a perspective leads to inconsistent conclusions. That is, the importance of a network structure changes as a function of the external perturbations acting on a community at any given point in time. Thus, we discuss a research agenda to investigate the relative importance of the structure of ecological networks under an environment-dependent framework. We hypothesize that only by studying systematically the link between network structure and community dynamics under an environment-dependent framework, we can uncover the limits at which communities can tolerate environmental changes.},

	abstract = {We review the need for increasing agricultural sustainability, how this can in part be delivered by positive biodiversity–ecosystem function (BEF) effects, the role within these of plant–plant facilitation, and how a better understanding of this role may help to deliver sustainable crop (particularly arable) production systems. Major challenges facing intensive arable production include overall declines in biodiversity, poor soil structure and health, nutrient and soil particle run-off, high greenhouse gas emissions, and increasing costs of synthetic inputs including herbicides, pesticides and fertilisers. Biodiversity–ecosystem function effects have the potential to deliver win–wins for arable food production, whereby enhanced biodiversity is associated with ‘good outcomes’ for farming sustainability, albeit sometimes through negative BEF effects for some components of the system. Although it can be difficult to separate explicitly from niche differentiation, evidence indicates facilitation can be a key component of these BEF effects. Explicit recognition of facilitation's role brings benefits to developing sustainable crop systems. First, it allows us to link fundamental ecological studies on the evolution of facilitation to the selection of traits that can enhance functioning in crop mixtures. Second, it provides us with analytical frameworks which can be used to bring structure and testable hypotheses to data derived from multiple (often independent) crop trials. Before concrete guidance can be provided to the agricultural sector as to how facilitation might be enhanced in crop systems, challenges exist with respect to quantifying facilitation, understanding the traits that maximise facilitation and integrating these traits into breeding programmes, components of an approach we suggest could be termed ‘Functional Ecological Selection’. Synthesis. Ultimately, better integration between ecologists and crop scientists will be essential in harnessing the benefits of ecological knowledge for developing more sustainable agriculture. We need to focus on understanding the mechanistic basis of strong facilitative interactions in crop systems and using this information to select and breed for improved combinations of genotypes and species as part of the Functional Ecological Selection approach.},

We addressed this question by quantifying the productivity of 14 species across an experimental diversity gradient in Minnesota.

Overyielding species were either superior N competitors (C4 grasses) or N ﬁxers (legumes). Surprisingly, these species were not most productive in monoculture, thus, the ÔselectionÕ of productive species in diverse plots did not cause the positive diversity–productivity relationship. Both positive (with legumes) and negative interspeciﬁc interactions (with C4 grasses) determined whether individual species overyielded. Foliar pathogens did not cause overyielding, although other natural enemies may be responsible. Overyielding species are not displacing underyielding species over time, implying that other diversity-promoting interactions also operate in this experiment.},

This study examined the consequences on productivity and quality of as well as competition and facilitation after introducing chicory into varies ryegrass–legume-based pastures in a field study over three consecutive growing seasons. A cultivar of chicory, suitable for grazing, in pure stand was found to out-yield a pure stand ryegrass in terms of dry matter and nitrogen (N) accumulation but was found to yield similar to mixtures of chicory and ryegrass. The inclusion of chicory, increased N accumulation per area unit irrespective of associated leguminous species but had no effect (P{\textgreater}0.05) on the combined dry matter yield of these mixtures as compared to the chicory–ryegrass mixture. Chicory was not found to co-exist well with associated fodder legumes but it co-existed well with perennial ryegrass. Determined by a direct 15N plant labelling technique, chicory transferred little N to associated legumes and under moderate soil N conditions it almost out-competed the white clover whereas lucerne was able to withstand the competition with birdsfoot trefoil as intermediate. Chicory and ryegrass did exchange N amounting to less than 5\% of the receiver plants’ N economy whereas the N transfer from the N-rich lucerne constituted 15\% of the associated ryegrass’ N economy but less (P{\textless}0.05) of the chicory's N economy. These differences are ascribed to the species’ root morphology and root zonation. Chicory accumulated large amounts of calcium, potassium, sodium and zinc but significant less of magnesium and manganese, irrespective of the N supply. In the case of sodium it was a short-term effect whereas calcium and possibly also sulphur, copper and zinc accumulation increased over time. It is concluded that chicory may improve the management of intensive dairy farms with a large N surplus because of the increase in productivity per unit area and N uptake efficiency and add significant improvements of the quality of the forage.},

	abstract = {Intercropping is a powerful way to promote a more diversified plant community in the field, thereby enabling complementary and facilitative relationships. In these systems, legumes are a key functional group, and are highly valued for the agroecological services they provide. This review identifies the different complementarity and facilitation processes in soils in intercropped legume/cereal systems and the key role of soil microorganisms in these processes. The intercropped legumes/cereal systems reduce inter-specific competition by enhancing complementarity/facilitation processes thereby improving the exploitation of resources, which is, in turn, reflected in the increase in plant production corresponding to greater efficiency of the agroecosystem as a whole. Plant production, including above- and belowground biomass, is positively correlated with microbial abundance and diversity. This microbial life is assumed to play a significant role in the availability and transfer of soil nutrients to plants as well as in plant health and soil fertility. Although we are currently unable to identify a reliable and exhaustive pattern of plant-microbe interactions, perhaps simply because no universal relationship exists between plants and microorganisms, reliable scenarios reveal strong trends and define the conditions required for successful intercropping systems and microbial interactions. Given our incomplete knowledge of facilitation processes and belowground interactions, intercropping systems must learn from and apply the experience gained in successful experiments. Intercropping dynamics play a critical role in explaining the establishment of facilitative root interactions and finally suggest perennial plant associations may be more effective than annual ones.},

	abstract = {Intercropping soybean (Glycine max L.) with sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L.) is common in the semiarid tropics of India. In most intercropping studies, little attention has been paid to belowground interaction and nutrient management other than N while assessing yield advantage. In a 5-yr field experiment (2000–2004), we evaluated the impact of fertilizer and organic manures on below- and aboveground interaction, competitive ability, and economic viability of this intercropping at the Indian Institute of Soil Science, Bhopal for deep Vertisol (isohyperthermic Typic Haplustert) of central India. Above- and belowground growth components as well as biological activities were greatly improved in intercropped sorghum while the value of these except nitrate reductase (NR) activity, soil microbial biomass C (SMBC), and dehydrogenase activity (DHA) were reduced in intercropped soybean indicating interspecies competition between component crops. The increased NR activity, SMBC, and DHA in intercropped soybean revealed interspecies facilitation between the component crops. This showed that interspecies competition concurred with interspecies facilitation in this system. We observed that yield and land equivalent ratio (LER) of both the intercrops increased over sole crops though based on aggressivity and relative crowding coefficient (RCC), sorghum (+) is more competitive than soybean. Interaction of yield with different components indicated that three belowground components, i.e., NR activity in root (r = 0.62, r = 0.63, P {\textless} 0.05), root length density (r = 0.36, r = 0.33, P {\textless} 0.05), and SMBC (r = 0.71, r = 0.66, P {\textless} 0.05) of both intercrop soybean and intercrop sorghum, respectively, had the greater effect on yield advantage in the intercropping system. Soybean did not benefit from intercropping to the same degree as sorghum under N–P–K. Nutrient application influenced LER, RCC, and monetary advantage index and was found in the order of N–P–K plus farmyard manure (FYM) {\textgreater} N–P–K plus poultry manure (PM) {\textgreater} N–P–K plus phosphocompost (PC) {\textgreater} N–P–K {\textgreater} control. However, based on competition ratio, yield advantage was greater under N–P–K plus PM. The results suggest that sorghum is the major contributor to the mixture yield and that the integrated use of N–P–K plus FYM or N–P–K plus PM is an important nutrient management option for sustaining this intercropping system, particularly to benefit the legume component.},

	abstract = {Intercropping is a farming practice involving two or more crop species, or genotypes, growing together and coexisting for a time. On the fringes of modern intensive agriculture, intercropping is important in many subsistence or low-input/resource-limited agricultural systems. By allowing genuine yield gains without increased inputs, or greater stability of yield with decreased inputs, intercropping could be one route to delivering ‘sustainable intensification’. We discuss how recent knowledge from agronomy, plant physiology and ecology can be combined with the aim of improving intercropping systems. Recent advances in agronomy and plant physiology include better understanding of the mechanisms of interactions between crop genotypes and species – for example, enhanced resource availability through niche complementarity. Ecological advances include better understanding of the context-dependency of interactions, the mechanisms behind disease and pest avoidance, the links between above- and below-ground systems, and the role of microtopographic variation in coexistence. This improved understanding can guide approaches for improving intercropping systems, including breeding crops for intercropping. Although such advances can help to improve intercropping systems, we suggest that other topics also need addressing. These include better assessment of the wider benefits of intercropping in terms of multiple ecosystem services, collaboration with agricultural engineering, and more effective interdisciplinary research.},

	abstract = {We review the need for increasing agricultural sustainability, how this can in part be delivered by positive biodiversity–ecosystem function (BEF) effects, the role within these of plant–plant facilitation, and how a better understanding of this role may help to deliver sustainable crop (particularly arable) production systems. Major challenges facing intensive arable production include overall declines in biodiversity, poor soil structure and health, nutrient and soil particle run-off, high greenhouse gas emissions, and increasing costs of synthetic inputs including herbicides, pesticides and fertilisers. Biodiversity–ecosystem function effects have the potential to deliver win–wins for arable food production, whereby enhanced biodiversity is associated with ‘good outcomes’ for farming sustainability, albeit sometimes through negative BEF effects for some components of the system. Although it can be difficult to separate explicitly from niche differentiation, evidence indicates facilitation can be a key component of these BEF effects. Explicit recognition of facilitation's role brings benefits to developing sustainable crop systems. First, it allows us to link fundamental ecological studies on the evolution of facilitation to the selection of traits that can enhance functioning in crop mixtures. Second, it provides us with analytical frameworks which can be used to bring structure and testable hypotheses to data derived from multiple (often independent) crop trials. Before concrete guidance can be provided to the agricultural sector as to how facilitation might be enhanced in crop systems, challenges exist with respect to quantifying facilitation, understanding the traits that maximise facilitation and integrating these traits into breeding programmes, components of an approach we suggest could be termed ‘Functional Ecological Selection’. Synthesis. Ultimately, better integration between ecologists and crop scientists will be essential in harnessing the benefits of ecological knowledge for developing more sustainable agriculture. We need to focus on understanding the mechanistic basis of strong facilitative interactions in crop systems and using this information to select and breed for improved combinations of genotypes and species as part of the Functional Ecological Selection approach.},

	abstract = {Intercropping is the simultaneous cultivation of more than one crop species on the same piece of land and is regarded as the practical application of basic ecological principles such as diversity, competition and facilitation. Field experiments were carried out on a sandy loam soil and a sandy soil in Denmark over three consecutive cropping seasons including dual grain legume (pea, faba bean and lupin)–barley intercropping as compared to the respective sole crops (SC). Yield stability of intercrops (IC) was not greater than that of grain legume SC, with the exception of the IC containing faba bean. Faba bean and lupin had lower yield stability than pea and fertilized barley. However, the different IC used environmental resources for plant growth up to 50\% (LER=0.91–1.51) more effectively as compared to the respective SC, but with considerable variation over location, years and crops. The SC performance supported the interspecific interactions within the IC stand. On the sandy loam 13\% greater grain yield of pea cv. Agadir (520 g m−2) was observed as compared to cv. Bohatyr. Faba bean and lupin yielded similarly (340 g m−2) in the sandy loam soil, with decreasing yields on the sandy soil (320–270 g m−2). Nitrogen fixation was very constant in grain legume SC over species and location, varying from 13.2 to 15.8 g N m−2, being lowest in peas and highest in faba bean and lupin. The intercropped grain legumes increased the proportion of plant N derived from N2-fixation by on average 10–15\% compared to the corresponding SC. However, especially lupin was suppressed when intercropping, with a reduced N2-fixation from 15 to 5–6 g N m−2. The IC were particularly effective at suppressing weeds, capturing a greater share of available resources than SC. Weed infestation in the different crops was comparable; however, it tended to be the highest in sole cropped faba bean, lupin and unfertilized barley, where the application of urea to barley reduced the weed infestation by around 50\%. Reduction in disease was observed in all IC systems compared to the corresponding SC, with a general disease reduction in the range of 20–40\%. For one disease in particular (brown spot on lupin) disease reduction was almost 80\% in the IC. Intercropping practices offer many advantages but improved understanding of the ecological mechanisms associated with planned spatial diversity, including additional benefits with associated diversity, is needed to enhance the benefits achieved.},

	abstract = {Background: Equids, especially zebras and donkeys, and cattle (bovids) share habitats in many savanna ecosystems in Africa. The issue of competition for food between these ungulate guilds remains largely unresolved. Resolving it will provide insights into how wild zebra are likely to interact with cattle on shared landscapes and suggest best practices for cattle owners who must decide whether to tolerate wild ungulates, some of which are severely threatened (e.g. Grevy’s zebra, Equus grevyi). Aim: Determine whether an equid and a bovid compete in a semi-arid savanna in Kenya. Organisms: Boran cattle (Bos indicus) and donkeys (Equus africanus asinus) – the latter as surrogates for zebras.
Methodology: Experiments to measure performance (weight gains), bite rates, diet quality (digestible organic matter and crude protein), and gastrointestinal worm burdens (parasite egg count per unit weight of faeces) of the two ungulate species when herded separately (single species) or together (mixed species). We used two stocking levels: low-density (one animal per 7 ha), a level typical of commercial ranchers; and high-density (one animal per 2 ha), a level typical of pastoral herders. Principal findings: When herded together, both species gained more weight, had higher bite rates (especially at low stocking density), and selected diets with a more favourable balance between digestible organic matter and crude protein, than when herded separately. In addition, parasite egg output in faeces of donkeys was reduced by 14–35\% following shared foraging with cattle.
Conclusion: Cattle (a ruminant) and donkeys (hindgut fermenters, closely related to zebras) showed no evidence of competion with each other. Rather, our results show a facilitative, rather than a competitive, interaction between them.},

One observation that, at first sight, seems incompatible with this idea is the fact that the establishment of new plants in dry areas is often restricted to shady sites under the canopy of other plants, called “nurse plants.” We use a graphical model to resolve this paradox. The model visualizes how facilitative patterns can be understood from the simultaneous effects of plant canopies on microsite light and moisture, and the growth responses of establishing seedlings to those factors. The approach emphasizes the fact that positive and negative effects of plant canopies always occur simultaneously. In the presented light–water model, facilitation only occurs when the improvement of plant water relations under the canopy exceeds the costs caused by lower light levels. This may be true under dry conditions, whereas in less dry situations, competition rather than facilitation is observed. The model shows how changes in water availability may shift interactions from competitive to facilitative and vice versa, as observed in some field patterns. It is argued that other environmental factors explaining facilitative patterns can be understood in the same context.},

First, controlled experiments which show generally positive relationships. Second, observational field data which show variable relationships. This latter source coupled with a lack of observed declines in local biodiversity has led to the argument that biodiversity-ecosystem functioning relationships may be uninformative for conservation and management. We review ecological theory and re-analyse several biodiversity datasets to argue that ecosystem function correlations with local diversity in observational field data are often difficult to interpret in the context of biodiversity-ecosystem function research. This occurs because biotic interactions filter species during community assembly which means that there can be a high biodiversity effect on functioning even with low observed local diversity. Our review indicates that we should not necessarily expect any specific relationship between local biodiversity and ecosystem function in observational field data. Rather, linking predictions from biodiversity-ecosystem function theory and experiments to observational field data requires considering the pool of species available during colonisation: the local species pool. We suggest that, even without local biodiversity declines, biodiversity loss at regional scales—which determines local species pools—may still negatively affect ecosystem functioning.},

Physical properties of the environment and functional properties of the entire ecosystem such as nutrient supply, transport, and recycling are shown to exert a profound influence on the composition, diversity, and assembly of the biological community. Community structure as well as the physical properties of the environment in turn affect ecosystem functions such as nutrient and energy flow. In particular, the rate of nutrient transport in the physical medium plays a critical role in competition and coexistence among food chains. The potential for coexistence decreases continuously as the nutrient transport rate increases in food chains with donor-controlled or no herbivory, while it increases continuously or is greatest at an intermediate value of the nutrient transport rate in herbivore-controlled food chains. On the other hand, energy flow generally increases with the rate of nutrient transport. Herbivory also exerts a significant, predictable influence on energy flow and coexistence among plants and food chains.},

We found that positive effects of biodiversity on ecosystem functioning decreased with increasing stress intensity in absolute terms. However, in relative terms, increasing stress had a stronger negative effect on low-diversity communities. This shows that more diverse biotic communities are functionally less susceptible to environmental stress, emphasises the need to maintain high levels of biodiversity as an insurance against impacts of changing environmental conditions and sets the stage for exploring the mechanisms underlying biodiversity effects in stressed ecosystems.},

Projections of a future warmer climate have stimulated studies on the response of terrestrial ecosystems to this global change. Experiments have likewise addressed the importance of species numbers for ecosystem functioning. There is, however, little knowledge on the interplay between warming and species richness. During three years, we grew experimental plant communities containing one, three or nine grassland species in 12 sunlit, climate-controlled chambers in Wilrijk, Belgium. Half of these chambers were exposed to ambient air temperatures (unheated), while the other half were warmed by 3\&deg;C (heated). Equal amounts of water were added to heated and unheated communities, so that warming would imply drier soils if evapotranspiration was higher. Biomass production was decreased due to warming, both aboveground (\&ndash;29\%) and belowground (\&ndash;25\%), as negative impacts of increased heat and drought stress in summer prevailed. Complementarity effects, likely mostly through both increased aboveground spatial complementarity and facilitative effects of legumes, led to higher shoot and root biomass in multi-species communities, regardless of the induced warming. Surprisingly, warming suppressed productivity the most in 9-species communities, which may be attributed to negative impacts of intense interspecific competition for resources under conditions of high abiotic stress. Our results suggest that warming and the associated soil drying could reduce primary production in many temperate grasslands, and that this will not necessarily be mitigated by efforts to maintain or increase species richness.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Anthropogenic climate change has emerged as a critical environmental problem, prompting frequent investigations into its consequences for various ecological systems. Few studies, however, have explored the effect of climate change on ecological stability and the underlying mechanisms. We conduct a field experiment to assess the influence of warming and altered precipitation on the temporal stability of plant community biomass in an alpine grassland located on the Tibetan Plateau. We find that whereas precipitation alteration does not influence biomass temporal stability, warming lowers stability through reducing the degree of species asynchrony. Importantly, biomass temporal stability is not influenced by plant species diversity, but is largely determined by the temporal stability of dominant species and asynchronous population dynamics among the coexisting species. Our findings suggest that ongoing and future climate change may alter stability properties of ecological communities, potentially hindering their ability to provide ecosystem services for humanity.},

	abstract = {Microbial species aren’t often found alone, but rather in complex communities containing dozens to hundreds of other species. These species affect one another in many ways. Species can harm one another by producing antibiotics, by stabbing one another and injecting toxins, or simply by consuming resources that others require (1⇓–3). Microbes can also impact one another positively. They can, for example, degrade antibiotics and detoxify the environment, secrete iron-scavenging molecules that allow other species to take up iron, or excrete metabolic byproducts that others can consume (4⇓–6). The ecology and evolution of these interactions are becoming more well characterized, but it’s unclear whether certain environmental conditions promote one form of interaction over another. In PNAS, Piccardi et al. (7) demonstrate that environmental stress in the form of toxic biocides causes interactions between 4 microbial species to become positive.

The stress gradient hypothesis (SGH) provides a framework to predict when positive or negative interactions should be observed (8). The SGH states that facilitation should be more common in stressful environments, compared with benign environments where competition should be more common (Fig. 1 A ). Since it was proposed, the SGH has mainly been tested in plant communities by growing species over a stress gradient (e.g., drought stress) and assessing changes in the nature and magnitude of their interactions. Metaanalyses have found that the SGH has had mixed support (9, 10). Some authors have argued that the predictive power of the SGH has been limited by a lack of specificity about which forms of stress should cause the pattern, and how other environmental gradients may influence interactions in combination with the stress gradient (11). In their study of a simple microbial community, Piccardi et …

	abstract = {Competition between microbes is extremely common, with many investing in mechanisms to harm other strains and species. Yet positive interactions between species have also been documented. What makes species help or harm each other is currently unclear. Here, we studied the interactions between 4 bacterial species capable of degrading metal working fluids (MWF), an industrial coolant and lubricant, which contains growth substrates as well as toxic biocides. We were surprised to find only positive or neutral interactions between the 4 species. Using mathematical modeling and further experiments, we show that positive interactions in this community were likely due to the toxicity of MWF, whereby each species’ detoxification benefited the others by facilitating their survival, such that they could grow and degrade MWF better when together. The addition of nutrients, the reduction of toxicity, or the addition of more species instead resulted in competitive behavior. Our work provides support to the stress gradient hypothesis by showing how harsh, toxic environments can strongly favor facilitation between microbial species and mask underlying competitive interactions.},

	abstract = {Interactions among co-infecting pathogens are common across host taxa and can affect infectious disease dynamics. Host nutrition can mediate these among-pathogen interactions, altering the establishment and growth of pathogens within hosts. It is unclear, however, how nutrition-mediated among-pathogen interactions affect transmission and the spread of disease through populations. We manipulated the nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) supplies to oat plants in growth chambers and evaluated interactions between two aphid-vectored Barley and Cereal Yellow Dwarf Viruses: PAV and RPV. We quantified the effect of each virus on the other’s establishment, within-plant density, and transmission. Co-inoculation significantly increased PAV density when N and P supplies were low and tended to increase RPV density when N supply was high. Co-infection increased PAV transmission when N and P supplies were low and tended to increase RPV transmission when N supply was high. Despite the parallels between the effects of among-pathogen interactions on density and transmission, changes in virus density only partially explained changes in transmission, suggesting that virus density-independent processes contribute to transmission. A mathematical model describing the spread of two viruses through a plant population, parameterized with empirically derived transmission values, demonstrated that nutrition-mediated among-pathogen interactions could affect disease spread. Interactions that altered transmission through virus density-independent processes determined overall disease dynamics. Our work suggests that host nutrition alters disease spread through among-pathogen interactions that modify transmission.},

	abstract = {Species diversity affects the functioning of ecosystems, including the efficiency by which communities capture limited resources, produce biomass, recycle and retain biologically essential nutrients. These ecological functions ultimately support the ecosystem services upon which humanity depends. Despite hundreds of experimental tests of the effect of biodiversity on ecosystem function (BEF), it remains unclear whether diversity effects are sufficiently general that we can use a single relationship to quantitatively predict how changes in species richness alter an ecosystem function across trophic levels, ecosystems and ecological conditions. Our objective here is to determine whether a general relationship exists between biodiversity and standing biomass. We used hierarchical mixed effects models, based on a power function between species richness and biomass production (Y = a × Sb), and a database of 374 published experiments to estimate the BEF relationship (the change in biomass with the addition of species), and its associated uncertainty, in the context of environmental factors. We found that the mean relationship (b = 0.26, 95\% CI: 0.16, 0.37) characterized the vast majority of observations, was robust to differences in experimental design, and was independent of the range of species richness levels considered. However, the richness–biomass relationship varied by trophic level and among ecosystems; in aquatic systems b was nearly twice as large for consumers (herbivores and detritivores) compared to primary producers; in terrestrial ecosystems, b for detritivores was negative but depended on few studies. We estimated changes in biomass expected for a range of changes in species richness, highlighting that species loss has greater implications than species gains, skewing a distribution of biomass change relative to observed species richness change. When biomass provides a good proxy for processes that underpin ecosystem services, this relationship could be used as a step in modeling the production of ecosystem services and their dependence on biodiversity.},

	abstract = {Trophic interactions between benthic invertebrates in a large freshwater pond were established using analyses of gut contents, laboratory feeding trials and published information. The web was detritus based and contained 36 "species". Spatial and temporal variation in food web structure was assessed by partitioning the overall food web into subwebs drawn up for two areas of the pond on each of five sampling dates over the course of a season. Substantial variation occurred between webs from the open water benthos and the pond margin areas, both within and between sampling dates. Webs became more complex (species rich) over the season and, within, the webs from each area, species composition and interactions varied due to body size and life history effects. In relation to published data the webs had high average connectance, high proportions of intermediate species (and links among intermediate species) and moderately high predator: prey ratios. Other food web statistics varied considerably, but most fell within the ranges of values from previous analyses. Omnivory was extensive and, due to size dependent predation, cannibalism and trophic loops occurred. The potential effects of spatial and temporal variation in the web on the dynamics of trophic interactions suggest that Cohen and Newman's "cascade model", which imposes simple, non-dynamic constraints on the distribution of trophic interactions, may be an appropriate explanation for web structure. However, simulated webs generated by the cascade model, using parameters derived from the webs in this study, indicated the model's sensitivity to connectance, and suggested that, in its present form, the model adequately accounts for the proportions of basal, top and intermediate species, but may not be a sufficient explanation for observed food chain lengths.},

	abstract = {Species are redistributing globally in response to climate warming, impacting ecosystem functions and services. In the Barents Sea, poleward expansion of boreal species and a decreased abundance of Arctic species are causing a rapid borealization of the Arctic communities. This borealization might have profound consequences on the Arctic food web by creating novel feeding interactions between previously non co-occurring species. An early identification of new feeding links is crucial to predict their ecological impact. However, detection by traditional approaches, including stomach content and isotope analyses, although fundamental, cannot cope with the speed of change observed in the region, nor with the urgency of understanding the consequences of species redistribution for the marine ecosystem. In this study, we used an extensive food web (metaweb) with nearly 2,500 documented feeding links between 239 taxa coupled with a trait data set to predict novel feeding interactions and to quantify their potential impact on Arctic food web structure. We found that feeding interactions are largely determined by the body size of interacting species, although species foraging habitat and metabolic type are also important predictors. Further, we found that all boreal species will have at least one potential resource in the Arctic region should they redistribute therein. During 2014–2017, 11 boreal species were observed in the Arctic region of the Barents Sea. These incoming species, which are all generalists, change the structural properties of the Arctic food web by increasing connectance and decreasing modularity. In addition, these boreal species are predicted to initiate novel feeding interactions with the Arctic residents, which might amplify their impact on Arctic food web structure affecting ecosystem functioning and vulnerability. Under the ongoing species redistribution caused by environmental change, we propose merging a trait-based approach with ecological network analysis to efficiently predict the impacts of range-shifting species on food webs.},

	abstract = {Food webs encapsulate the functional makeup of natural communities by describing both the number and identity of species present, and how they interact with each other. Yet, how different aspects of food web organisation vary in time is still poorly known. In this study, we used multiple complementary descriptors of food web composition and structure to examine the temporal consistency of 22 local food webs as followed over two consecutive years. The focal food webs consisted of specialist herbivore hosts (gallers and miners) and their natural enemies (parasitic and inquiline wasps) on individual pedunculate oaks, Quercus robur. In the changes detected among years, we searched for effects of species- specific ecological traits (abundance, trophic rank and feeding guild) on the persistence of species within local communities. Local food webs showed high consistency between years in terms of species richness and quantitative structure. Nonetheless, the species composition and the qualitative link structure of the webs changed dramatically over time. While different aspects of food web structure revealed different levels of consistency in time, species turnover did leave a detectable imprint on quantitative and qualitative descriptors of food web structure. Overall, a mean 44\% of all species present in a community in 2006 were no longer detected in 2007, whereas 31\% of the species encountered in 2007 were new to the site. Species turnover was unevenly distributed among feeding guilds, and increased with a decreasing abundance of the species. The patterns uncovered suggest that quantitative, emergent characteristics of food web structure will exhibit less temporal variation than patterns at the level of individual food web parts. However, as these features reflect different, complementary aspects of how food webs are built and how communities are likely to function, patterns at both levels should be considered in assessing the temporal stability of natural communities.},

	abstract = {Species monitoring, defined here as the repeated, systematic collection of data to detect long-term changes in the populations of wild species, is a vital component of conservation practice and policy. We created a database of nearly 1200 schemes, ranging in start date from 1800 to 2018, to review spatial, temporal, taxonomic, and methodological patterns in global species monitoring. We identified monitoring schemes through standardized web searches, an online survey of stakeholders, in-depth national searches in a sample of countries, and a review of global biodiversity databases. We estimated the total global number of monitoring schemes operating at 3300–15,000. Since 2000, there has been a sharp increase in the number of new schemes being initiated in lower- and middle-income countries and in megadiverse countries, but a decrease in high-income countries. The total number of monitoring schemes in a country and its per capita gross domestic product were strongly, positively correlated. Schemes that were active in 2018 had been running for an average of 21 years in high-income countries, compared with 13 years in middle-income countries and 10 years in low-income countries. In high-income countries, over one-half of monitoring schemes received government funding, but this was less than one-quarter in low-income countries. Data collection was undertaken partly or wholly by volunteers in 37\% of schemes, and such schemes covered significantly more sites and species than those undertaken by professionals alone. Birds were by far the most widely monitored taxonomic group, accounting for around half of all schemes, but this bias declined over time. Monitoring in most taxonomic groups remains sparse and uncoordinated, and most of the data generated are elusive and unlikely to feed into wider biodiversity conservation processes. These shortcomings could be addressed by, for example, creating an open global meta-database of biodiversity monitoring schemes and enhancing capacity for species monitoring in countries with high biodiversity.

	abstract = {Estimates of biodiversity change are essential for the management and conservation of ecosystems. Accurate estimates rely on selecting representative sites, but monitoring often focuses on sites of special interest. How such site-selection biases influence estimates of biodiversity change is largely unknown. Site-selection bias potentially occurs across four major sources of biodiversity data, decreasing in likelihood from citizen science, museums, national park monitoring, and academic research. We defined site-selection bias as a preference for sites that are either densely populated (i.e., abundance bias) or species rich (i.e., richness bias). We simulated biodiversity change in a virtual landscape and tracked the observed biodiversity at a sampled site. The site was selected either randomly or with a site-selection bias. We used a simple spatially resolved, individual-based model to predict the movement or dispersal of individuals in and out of the chosen sampling site. Site-selection bias exaggerated estimates of biodiversity loss in sites selected with a bias by on average 300–400\% compared with randomly selected sites. Based on our simulations, site-selection bias resulted in positive trends being estimated as negative trends: richness increase was estimated as 0.1 in randomly selected sites, whereas sites selected with a bias showed a richness change of −0.1 to −0.2 on average. Thus, site-selection bias may falsely indicate decreases in biodiversity. We varied sampling design and characteristics of the species and found that site-selection biases were strongest in short time series, for small grains, organisms with low dispersal ability, large regional species pools, and strong spatial aggregation. Based on these findings, to minimize site-selection bias, we recommend use of systematic site-selection schemes; maximizing sampling area; calculating biodiversity measures cumulatively across plots; and use of biodiversity measures that are less sensitive to rare species, such as the effective number of species. Awareness of the potential impact of site-selection bias is needed for biodiversity monitoring, the design of new studies on biodiversity change, and the interpretation of existing data.},

	abstract = {Classically, biomass partitioning across trophic levels was thought to add up to a pyramidal distribution. Numerous exceptions have, however, been noted including complete pyramidal inversions. Elevated levels of biomass top-heaviness (i.e. high consumer/resource biomass ratios) have been reported from Arctic tundra communities to Brazilian phytotelmata, and in species assemblages as diverse as those dominated by sharks and ants. We highlight two major pathways for creating top-heaviness, via: (1) endogenous channels that enhance energy transfer across trophic boundaries within a community and (2) exogenous pathways that transfer energy into communities from across spatial and temporal boundaries. Consumer–resource models and allometric trophic network models combined with niche models reveal the nature of core mechanisms for promoting top-heaviness. Outputs from these models suggest that top-heavy communities can be stable, but they also reveal sources of instability. Humans are both increasing and decreasing top-heaviness in nature with ecological consequences. Current and future research on the drivers of top-heaviness can help elucidate fundamental mechanisms that shape the architecture of ecological communities and govern energy ﬂux within and between communities. Questions emerging from the study of top-heaviness also usefully draw attention to the incompleteness and inconsistency by which ecologists often establish deﬁnitional boundaries for communities.},

Efforts to identify general mechanisms that limit invasion success, however, have been frustrated by disagreement between landscape-scale observations that generally find a positive relationship between native diversity and invasibility and smaller-scale experiments that consistently reveal competitive interactions that generate the opposite relationship. Here we experimentally elucidate the mechanism explaining the large-scale positive associations between invasion success and native intertidal diversity revealed in our landscape-scale surveys of New England shorelines. Experimental manipulations revealed this large-scale pattern is driven by a facilitation cascade where ecosystem-engineering species interact nonlinearly to enhance native diversity and invasion success by alleviating thermal stress and substrate instability. Our findings reveal that large-scale diversity–invasion relationships can be explained by small-scale positive interactions that commonly occur across multiple trophic levels and functional groups. We argue that facilitation has played an important but unrecognized role in the invasion of other well studied systems, and will be of increasing importance with anticipated climate change.},

Recently, the presence of C. fluminea was associated with changes in benthic and epibenthic fauna. In this study, we aimed to understand the mechanisms underlying the effects of C. fluminea on an estuarine macrozoobenthic assemblage using a manipulative experiment. We used 5 different treatments (control, rock, closed, live, open), which were placed in a low sandy intertidal soft bottom area in the Minho estuary (NW Iberian Peninsula) for 2 months. We found that the presence of live and open empty shells of C. fluminea had positive effects on the density, biomass and species richness of macrozoobenthos, specifically on species belonging to Annelida, Mollusca and Crustacea. Our results may be explained by 2 main mechanisms: (1) the production of feces and pseudofeces by C. fluminea, which increases organic matter content and food resources for some macrozoobenthic species; and (2) ecosystem engineering activities by C. fluminea, which can create conditions for the establishment of other species via shell production and bioturbation in the sediments.},

	abstract = {Although the predatory and competitive impacts of biological invasions are well documented, facilitation of native species by non-indigenous species is frequently overlooked. A search through recent ecological literature found that facilitative interactions between invasive and native species occur in a wide range of habitats, can have cascading effects across trophic levels, can re-structure communities, and can lead to evolutionary changes. These are critical findings that, until now, have been mostly absent from analyses of ecological impacts of biological invasions. Here I present evidence for several mechanisms that exemplify how exotic species can facilitate native species. These mechanisms include habitat modification, trophic subsidy, pollination, competitive release, and predatory release. Habitat modification is the most frequently documented mechanism, reflecting the drastic changes generated by the invasion of functionally novel habitat engineers. Further, I predict that facilitative impacts on native species will be most likely when invasive species provide a limiting resource, increase habitat complexity, functionally replace a native species, or ameliorate predation or competition. Finally, three types of facilitation (novel, substitutive, and indirect) define why exotic species can lead to facilitation of native species. It is evident that understanding biological invasions at the community and ecosystem levels will be more accurate if we integrate facilitative interactions into future ecological research. Since facilitative impacts of biological invasions can occur with native endangered species, and can have wide-ranging impacts, these results also have important implications for management, eradication, and restoration.},

	abstract = {Non-random species loss and gain in local communities change the compositional heterogeneity between communities over time, which is traditionally quantified with dissimilarity-based approaches. Yet, dissimilarities summarize the multivariate species data into a univariate index and obscure the species-level patterns of change, which are central to understand the causes and consequences of the community changes. Here, we propose a model-based approach that looks for species-level effects of time period and construct a multiple-site metric as a sum across species to test the consistency of the individual species responses. Species fall into different response types, showing how they influence the changes in community heterogeneity. In a comparison with other multiple-site metrics, we illustrate the properties of our method and the differences and similarities with other approaches. For instance, our metric estimates the total variation in a community data set based on species-level contributions, not the compositional dissimilarities between particular sites. Similar to some other approaches, we can distinguish between heterogeneity derived from turnover or richness differences. Our approach was applied to a set of 23 forest understorey resurvey studies spread across Europe. We show the species gains and losses may as well decrease or increase levels of community heterogeneity. Although species occurrences and communities have not changed in a consistent way along continental-scale environmental gradients such as climatic conditions, several species shifted in a similar way across the different data sets. Testing the significance of shifts in species prevalence over time to infer corresponding changes in the compositional heterogeneity among sites provides a very intuitive tool for community resurvey studies. The main strengths of our framework are the explicit consideration of the relative roles of species gains and losses and the straightforward generalization to different sets of hypotheses related to community changes.},

Leaf growth is more sensitive to salinity than root growth, so we focus on the process or processes that might limit leaf expansion. Effects of short-term exposure (days) are considered separately from long-term exposure (weeks to years). The answer in the short term is probably the water status of the root and we suggest that a message from the root is regulating leaf expansion. The answer to what limits growth in the long term may be the maximum salt concentration tolerated by the fully expanded leaves of the shoot; if the rate of leaf death approaches the rate of new leaf expansion, the photosynthetic area will eventually become too low to support continued growth.},

Biotic resistance derives from local species interactions, yet global and regional studies often analyze data at coarse spatial grains. In addition, differences in competitive environments across regions may confound tests of biotic resistance based solely on native species richness of the invaded community. Using global and regional data sets for ﬁshes in river and stream reaches, we ask two questions: (1) does a negative relationship exist between native and non-native species richness and (2) do non-native species originate from higher diversity systems. A negative relationship between native and non-native species richness in local assemblages was found at the global scale, while regional patterns revealed the opposite trend. At both spatial scales, however, nearly all non-native species originated from river basins with higher native species richness than the basin of the invaded community. Together, these ﬁndings imply that coevolved ecological interactions in species-rich systems inhibit establishment of generalist nonnative species from less diverse communities. Consideration of both the ecological and evolutionary aspects of community assembly is critical to understanding invasion patterns. Distinct evolutionary histories in different regions strongly inﬂuence invasion of intact communities that are relatively unimpacted by human actions, and may explain the conﬂicting relationship between native and non-native species richness found at different spatial scales.},

	abstract = {Because biodiversity is multidimensional and scale-dependent, it is challenging to estimate its change. However, it is unclear (1) how much scale-dependence matters for empirical studies, and (2) if it does matter, how exactly we should quantify biodiversity change. To address the ﬁrst question, we analysed studies with comparisons among multiple assemblages, and found that rarefaction curves frequently crossed, implying reversals in the ranking of species richness across spatial scales. Moreover, the most frequently measured aspect of diversity – species richness – was poorly correlated with other measures of diversity. Second, we collated studies that included spatial scale in their estimates of biodiversity change in response to ecological drivers and found frequent and strong scale-dependence, including nearly 10\% of studies which showed that biodiversity changes switched directions across scales. Having established the complexity of empirical biodiversity comparisons, we describe a synthesis of methods based on rarefaction curves that allow more explicit analyses of spatial and sampling effects on biodiversity comparisons. We use a case study of nutrient additions in experimental ponds to illustrate how this multi-dimensional and multi-scale perspective informs the responses of biodiversity to ecological drivers.},

	abstract = {When tropical systems lose species, they are often assumed to be buffered against declines in functional diversity by the ability of the species-rich biota to display high functional redundancy: i.e., a high number of species performing similar functions. We tested this hypothesis using a ninefold richness gradient in global fish faunas on tropical reefs encompassing 6,316 species distributed among 646 functional entities (FEs): i.e., unique combinations of functional traits. We found that the highest functional redundancy is located in the Central Indo-Pacific with a mean of 7.9 species per FE. However, this overall level of redundancy is disproportionately packed into few FEs, a pattern termed functional over-redundancy (FOR). For instance, the most speciose FE in the Central Indo-Pacific contains 222 species (out of 3,689) whereas 38\% of FEs (180 out of 468) have no functional insurance with only one species. Surprisingly, the level of FOR is consistent across the six fish faunas, meaning that, whatever the richness, over a third of the species may still be in overrepresented FEs whereas more than one third of the FEs are left without insurance, these levels all being significantly higher than expected by chance. Thus, our study shows that, even in high-diversity systems, such as tropical reefs, functional diversity remains highly vulnerable to species loss. Although further investigations are needed to specifically address the influence of redundant vs. vulnerable FEs on ecosystem functioning, our results suggest that the promised benefits from tropical biodiversity may not be as strong as previously thought.},

Here, we estimated the links among environmental conditions, richness, food-web structure, annual biomass and its temporal stability using a standardised monitoring dataset of 99 stream fish communities spanning from 1995 to 2018. We first revealed that both richness and average trophic level are positively related to annual biomass, with effects of similar strength. Second, we found that community stability is fostered by mean trophic level, while contrary to expectation, it is decreased by species richness. Finally, we found that environmental conditions affect both biomass and its stability mainly via effects on richness and network structure. Strikingly, the effect of species richness on community stability was mediated by population stability rather than synchrony, which contrasts with results from single trophic communities. We discuss the hypothesis that it could be a characteristic of multi-trophic communities.},

Ecology has a long history of studies on negative interactions, such as predation and competition. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of positive interactions, such as facilitation in nature. The integration of these interactions into modern ecological theory has nonetheless lagged behind. This thesis aims at contributing to this research effort and addresses two core questions : (i) How does indirect facilitation (through protection against grazing) affect the functional structure (characteristics of trait distributions) of plant communities? (ii) Does the net effect of the interactions between a species pair (benefactor-beneficiary) remain valid in the presence of several beneficiary species at community level? We set up two insitu experiments in contrasted environments: a grazing exclusion experiment in tropical alpine peatlands and a transplantation experiment of sapling communities beneath adult plants in a mediterranean environment. Our results showed that indirect facilitation affects the characteristics of the environmental filter, species dominance and niche differentiation in the community. Our results also suggested that the composition of sapling communities modifies adult-sapling interactions, thereby questioning the possibility of extrapolating results from pairs of individuals to the community scale.},

In theory, concomitant decreases in other stressors (e.g. pollution, fragmentation) could offset some warming effects, paying climatic debt with accrued environmental credit. This process may be occurring in many western European rivers. We fit a Markov chain model to {\textasciitilde}20,000 macroinvertebrate samples from England and Wales, and demonstrate that despite large temperature increases 1991–2011, macroinvertebrate communities remained close to their predicted equilibrium with environmental conditions. Using a novel analysis of multiple stressors, an accumulated climatic debt of 0.64 (±0.13 standard error) °C of warming was paid by a water-quality credit equivalent to 0.89 (±0.04)°C of cooling. Although there is finite scope for mitigating additional climate warming in this way, water quality improvements appear to have offset recent temperature increases, and the concept of environmental credit may be a useful tool for communicating climate offsetting.},

	abstract = {Spatial rarity is often used to predict extinction risk, but rarity can also occur temporally. Perhaps more relevant in the context of global change is whether a species is core to a community (persistent) or transient (intermittently present), with transient species often susceptible to human activities that reduce niche space. Using 5–12 yr of data on 1,447 plant species from 49 grasslands on five continents, we show that local abundance and species persistence under ambient conditions are both effective predictors of local extinction risk following experimental exclusion of grazers or addition of nutrients; persistence was a more powerful predictor than local abundance. While perturbations increased the risk of exclusion for low persistence and abundance species, transient but abundant species were also highly likely to be excluded from a perturbed plot relative to ambient conditions. Moreover, low persistence and low abundance species that were not excluded from perturbed plots tended to have a modest increase in abundance following perturbance. Last, even core species with high abundances had large decreases in persistence and increased losses in perturbed plots, threatening the long-term stability of these grasslands. Our results demonstrate that expanding the concept of rarity to include temporal dynamics, in addition to local abundance, more effectively predicts extinction risk in response to environmental change than either rarity axis predicts alone.},

Here, we quantified the temporal trends of two key components of resilience—resistance and recovery—in {\textgreater}2000 population time-series of {\textgreater}1000 vertebrate species globally. We show that the number of threats to which a population is exposed is the main driver of resilience decline in vertebrate populations. Such declines are driven by a non-uniform loss of different components of resilience (i.e. resistance and recovery). Increased anthropogenic threats accelerating resilience loss through a decline in the recovery ability—but not resistance—of vertebrate populations. These findings suggest we may be underestimating the impacts of global change, highlighting the need to account for the multiple components of resilience in global biodiversity assessments.},

Some existing indicators of the status and trends of biodiversity largely rely on publicly available data from the scientific and grey literature, and are therefore prone to biases introduced through over-representation of well-studied groups and regions in monitoring schemes. This can give misleading estimates of biodiversity trends. Here, we report on an approach to tackle taxonomic and geographic bias in one such indicator (Living Planet Index) by accounting for the estimated number of species within biogeographical realms, and the relative diversity of species within them. Based on a proportionally weighted index, we estimate a global population decline in vertebrate species between 1970 and 2012 of 58\% rather than 20\% from an index with no proportional weighting. From this data set, comprising 14,152 populations of 3,706 species from 3,095 data sources, we also find that freshwater populations have declined by 81\%, marine populations by 36\%, and terrestrial populations by 38\% when using proportional weighting (compared to trends of -46\%, +12\% and +15\% respectively). These results not only show starker declines than previously estimated, but suggests that those species for which there is poorer data coverage may be declining more rapidly.},

	abstract = {Rapid human-driven environmental changes are impacting animal populations around the world. Currently, land-use and climate change are two of the biggest pressures facing biodiversity. However, studies investigating the impacts of these pressures on population trends often do not consider potential interactions between climate and land-use change. Further, a population's climatic position (how close the ambient temperature and precipitation conditions are to the species’ climatic tolerance limits) is known to influence responses to climate change but has yet to be investigated with regard to its influence on land-use change responses over time. Consequently, important variations across species’ ranges in responses to environmental changes may be being overlooked. Here, we combine data from the Living Planet and BioTIME databases to carry out a global analysis exploring the impacts of land use, habitat loss, climatic position, climate change and the interactions between these variables, on vertebrate population trends. By bringing these datasets together, we analyse over 7,000 populations across 42 countries. We find that land-use change is interacting with climate change and a population's climatic position to influence rates of population change. Moreover, features of a population's local landscape (such as surrounding land cover) play important roles in these interactions. For example, populations in agricultural land uses where maximum temperatures were closer to their hot thermal limit, declined at faster rates when there had also been rapid losses in surrounding semi-natural habitat. The complex interactions between these variables on populations highlight the importance of taking intraspecific variation and interactions between local and global pressures into account. Understanding how drivers of change are interacting and impacting populations, and how this varies spatially, is critical if we are to identify populations at risk, predict species’ responses to future environmental changes and produce suitable conservation strategies.},

	abstract = {Rapid human-­driven environmental changes are impacting animal populations around the world. Currently, land-­use and climate change are two of the biggest pressures facing biodiversity. However, studies investigating the impacts of these pressures on population trends often do not consider potential interactions between climate and land-­use change. Further, a population's climatic position (how close the ambient temperature and precipitation conditions are to the species’ climatic tolerance limits) is known to influence responses to climate change but has yet to be investigated with regard to its influence on land-­use change responses over time. Consequently, important variations across species’ ranges in responses to environmental changes may be being overlooked. Here, we combine data from the Living Planet and BioTIME databases to carry out a global analysis exploring the impacts of land use, habitat loss, climatic position, climate change and the interactions between these variables, on vertebrate population trends. By bringing these datasets together, we analyse over 7,000 populations across 42 countries. We find that land-­use change is interacting with climate change and a population's climatic position to influence rates of population change. Moreover, features of a population's local landscape (such as surrounding land cover) play important roles in these interactions. For example, populations in agricultural land uses where maximum temperatures were closer to their hot thermal limit, declined at faster rates when there had also been rapid losses in surrounding semi-­natural habitat. The complex interactions between these variables on populations highlight the importance of taking intraspecific variation and interactions between local and global pressures into account. Understanding how drivers of change are interacting and impacting populations, and how this varies spatially, is critical if we are to identify populations at risk, predict species’ responses to future environmental changes and produce suitable conservation strategies.},

	abstract = {Abstract: The task of measuring the decline of global biodiversity and instituting changes to halt and reverse this downturn has been taken up in response to the Convention on Biological Diversity's 2010 target. It is an undertaking made more difficult by the complex nature of biodiversity and the consequent difficulty in accurately gauging its depletion. In the Living Planet Index, aggregated population trends among vertebrate species indicate the rate of change in the status of biodiversity, and this index can be used to address the question of whether or not the 2010 target has been achieved. We investigated the use of generalized additive models in aggregating large quantities of population trend data, evaluated potential bias that results from collation of existing trends, and explored the feasibility of disaggregating the data (e.g., geographically, taxonomically, regionally, and by thematic area). Our results show strengths in length and completeness of data, little evidence of bias toward threatened species, and the possibility of disaggregation into meaningful subsets. Limitations of the data set are still apparent, in particular the dominance of bird data and gaps in tropical-species population coverage. Population-trend data complement the longer-term, but more coarse-grained, perspectives gained by evaluating species-level extinction rates. To measure progress toward the 2010 target, indicators must be adapted and strategically supplemented with existing data to generate meaningful indicators in time. Beyond 2010, it is critical a strategy be set out for the future development of indicators that will deal with existing data gaps and that is intricately tied to the goals of future biodiversity targets.},

While the subsequent Aichi 2020 targets are more wide-ranging, they also seek to reduce the rate of biodiversity loss. The geometric mean of relative abundance indices, G, is increasingly being used to examine trends in biological diversity and to assess whether biodiversity targets are being met. Here, we explore the mathematical and statistical properties of G that make it useful for judging temporal change in biological diversity, and we discuss its advantages and limitations relative to other measures. We demonstrate that the index reflects trends in both abundance and evenness, and that it is not prone to bias when detectability of individuals varies by species. We note that it allows data from different surveys to be combined to generate a composite index. However, the index exhibits high variance and unstable behaviour when rarely-recorded species are included in the analyses.},

	abstract = {Biodiversity indices often combine data from different species when used in monitoring programs. Heuristic properties can suggest preferred indices, but we lack objective ways to discriminate between indices with similar heuristics. Biodiversity indices can be evaluated by determining how well they reflect management objectives that a monitoring program aims to support. For example, the Convention on Biological Diversity requires reporting about extinction rates, so simple indices that reflect extinction risk would be valuable. We developed 3 biodiversity indices that are based on simple models of population viability that relate extinction risk to abundance. We based the first index on the geometric mean abundance of species and the second on a more general power mean. In a third index, we integrated the geometric mean abundance and trend. These indices require the same data as previous indices, but they also relate directly to extinction risk. Field data for butterflies and woodland plants and experimental studies of protozoan communities show that the indices correlate with local extinction rates. Applying the index based on the geometric mean to global data on changes in avian abundance suggested that the average extinction probability of birds has increased approximately 1\% from 1970 to 2009.

Using a database describing vertebrate assemblages in different land uses, we assess how the type and intensity of land use affect the functional diversity of vertebrates globally. We find that human land uses alter local functional structure by driving declines in functional diversity, with the strongest effects in the most disturbed land uses (intensely used urban sites, cropland and pastures), and among amphibians and birds. Both tropical and temperate areas experience important functional losses, which are only partially offset by functional gains. Tropical assemblages are more likely to show decreases in functional diversity that exceed those expected from species loss alone. Our results indicate that land-use change non-randomly reshapes the functional structure of vertebrate assemblages, raising concerns about the continuation of ecological processes sustained by vertebrates.},

We advocate for indices that: (i) satisfy key mathematical axioms; (ii) can be expressed as so-called effective numbers; (iii) can be extended to account for disparity between types; (iv) can be parameterized to obtain diversity proﬁles; and (v) for which an estimator (preferably unbiased) can be found so that the index is useful for practical applications.},

	abstract = {The composition of communities is strongly altered by anthropogenic manipulations of biogeochemical cycles, abiotic conditions, and trophic structure in all major ecosystems. Whereas the effects of species loss on ecosystem processes have received broad attention, the consequences of altered species dominance for emergent properties of communities and ecosystems are poorly investigated. Here we propose a framework guiding our understanding of how dominance affects species interactions within communities, processes within ecosystems, and dynamics on regional scales. Dominance (or the complementary term, evenness) reflects the distribution of traits in a community, which in turn affects the strength and sign of both intraspecifc and interspecific interactions. Consequently, dominance also mediates the effect of such interactions on species coexistence. We review the evidence for the fact that dominance directly affects ecosystem functions such as process rates via species identity (the dominant trait) and evenness (the frequency distribution of traits), and indirectly alters the relationship between process rates and species richness. Dominance also influences the temporal and spatial variability of aggregate community properties and compositional stability (invasibility). Finally, we propose that dominance affects regional species coexistence by altering metacommunity dynamics. Local dominance leads to high beta diversity, and rare species can persist because of source–sink dynamics, but anthropogenically induced environmental changes result in regional dominance and low beta diversity, reducing regional coexistence. Given the rapid anthropogenic alterations of dominance in many ecosystems and the strong implications of these changes, dominance should be considered explicitly in the analysis of consequences of altered biodiversity.},

Average TD and FD increased at all but the global scale. Change in TD exceeded change in FD toward large scales, signaling functional resilience. Assemblage temporal dissimilarity and turnover (replacement of species or functions) declined, while nestedness (tendency of assemblages to be subsets of one another) increased with scale.

The inflation of functional richness was paired with changes in the functional structure of assemblages, with shifts of species position toward the border of the functional space of assemblages (i.e. increased functional divergence). Non-native species moreover caused shifts in functional identity toward higher body sized and less elongated species for most of assemblages throughout the world.

Here, we analyse an exceptionally comprehensive 29-year time series of North Atlantic groundfish assemblages monitored over 5° latitude to the west of Scotland. These fish assemblages show no systematic change in species richness through time, but steady change in species composition, leading to an increase in spatial homogenization: the species identity of colder northern localities increasingly resembles that of warmer southern localities. This biotic homogenization mirrors the spatial pattern of unevenly rising ocean temperatures over the same time period suggesting that climate change is primarily responsible for the spatial homogenization we observe. In this and other ecosystems, apparent constancy in species richness may mask major changes in species composition driven by anthropogenic change.},

	abstract = {1. Indices quantifying the functional aspect of biodiversity are essential in understanding relationships between biodiversity, ecosystem functioning and environmental constraints. Many indices of functional diversity have been published but we lack consensus about what indices quantify, how redundant they are and which ones are recommended. 2. This study aims to build a typology of functional diversity indices from artificial data sets encompassing various community structures (different assembly rules, various species richness levels) and to identify a set of independent indices able to discriminate community assembly rules. 3. Our results confirm that indices can be divided into three main categories, each of these corresponding to one aspect of functional diversity: functional richness, functional evenness and functional divergence. Most published indices are highly correlated and quantify functional richness while quadratic entropy (Q) represents a mix between functional richness and functional divergence. Conversely, two indices (FEve and FDiv respectively quantifying functional evenness and functional divergence) are rather independent to all the others. The power analysis revealed that some indices efficiently detect assembly rules while others performed poorly. 4. To accurately assess functional diversity and establish its relationships with ecosystem functioning and environmental constraints, we recommend investigating each functional component separately with the appropriate index. Guidelines are provided to help choosing appropriate indices given the issue being investigated. 5. This study demonstrates that functional diversity indices have the potential to reveal the processes that structure biological communities. Combined with complementary methods (phylogenetic and taxonomic diversity), the multifaceted framework of functional diversity will help improve our understanding of how biodiversity interacts with ecosystem processes and environmental constraints.},

	abstract = {Several approaches have been developed over the last decade to simultaneously estimate distribution or density for multiple species (e.g. “joint species distribution” or “multispecies occupancy” models). However, there has been little research comparing estimates of abundance trends or distribution shifts from these multispecies models with similar single-species estimates. We seek to determine whether a model including correlations among species (and particularly species that may affect habitat quality, termed “biogenic habitat”) improves predictive performance or decreases standard errors for estimates of total biomass and distribution shift relative to similar single-species models. To accomplish this objective, we apply a vector-autoregressive spatio-temporal (VAST) model that simultaneously estimates spatio-temporal variation in density for multiple species, and present an application of this model using data for eight US Pacific Coast rockfishes (Sebastes spp.), thornyheads (Sebastolobus spp.), and structure-forming invertebrates (SFIs). We identified three fish groups having similar spatial distribution (northern Sebastes, coastwide Sebastes, and Sebastolobus species), and estimated differences among groups in their association with SFI. The multispecies model was more parsimonious and had better predictive performance than fitting a single-species model to each taxon individually, and estimated fine-scale variation in density even for species with relatively few encounters (which the single-species model was unable to do). However, the single-species models showed similar abundance trends and distribution shifts to those of the multispecies model, with slightly smaller standard errors. Therefore, we conclude that spatial variation in density (and annual variation in these patterns) is correlated among fishes and SFI, with congeneric fishes more correlated than species from different genera. However, explicitly modelling correlations among fishes and biogenic habitat does not seem to improve precision for estimates of abundance trends or distribution shifts for these fishes.},

We describe methods of analysis that can be applied to a matrix of counts of individuals that is organized by species (rows) and time-ordered sampling periods (columns). We first developed a bootstrapping procedure to test the null hypothesis of random sampling from a stationary species abundance distribution with temporally varying sampling probabilities. This procedure can be modified to account for undetected species. We next developed a hierarchical model to estimate species-specific trends in abundance while accounting for species-specific probabilities of detection. We analysed two long-term datasets on stream fishes and grassland insects to demonstrate these methods. For both assemblages, the bootstrap test indicated that temporal trends in abundance were more heterogeneous than expected under the null model. We used the hierarchical model to estimate trends in abundance and identified sets of species in each assemblage that were steadily increasing, decreasing or remaining constant in abundance over more than a decade of standardized annual surveys. Our methods of analysis are broadly applicable to other ecological datasets, and they represent an advance over most existing procedures, which do not incorporate effects of incomplete sampling and imperfect detection.},

	abstract = {Joint Species Distribution Models (JSDM) provide a general multivariate framework to study the joint abundances of all species from a community. JSDM account for both structuring factors (environmental characteristics or gradients, such as habitat type or nutrient availability) and potential interactions between the species (competition, mutualism, parasitism, etc.), which is instrumental in disentangling meaningful ecological interactions from mere statistical associations. Modeling the dependency between the species is challenging because of the count-valued nature of abundance data and most JSDM rely on Gaussian latent layer to encode the dependencies between species in a covariance matrix. The multivariate Poisson-lognormal (PLN) model is one such model, which can be viewed as a multivariate mixed Poisson regression model. Inferring such models raises both statistical and computational issues, many of which were solved in recent contributions using variational techniques and convex optimization tools. The PLN model turns out to be a versatile framework, within which a variety of analyses can be performed, including multivariate sample comparison, clustering of sites or samples, dimension reduction (ordination) for visualization purposes, or inferring interaction networks. This paper presents the general PLN framework and illustrates its use on a series a typical experimental datasets. All the models and methods are implemented in the R package PLNmodels, available from cran.r-project.org.},

Elements of all three fields are combined in a broad quantitative approach to answer questions such as how much sunlight is in an eagle and how much coal is needed to produce a loaf of bread. The method is illustrated in this article by example calculations for a two-compartment ecosystem, showing how changing from a chain to a web (i.e., increasing recycling) affects results. Besides energy intensity, the approach also allows determine nutrient intensity, trophic position, path length, and residence time. While calculations such as these are usually done for steady-state systems, also determined are these indicators for systems changing over time, as in response to perturbation. Three different, but related, applications are then presented: (1) calculating these quantities for a four-compartment bog ecosystem; (2) calculating the energy cost of living, the (mostly fossil) energy to support a household’s consumption of all goods and services; (3) using the results of (2) to determine the regressivity of an energy tax and how to modify income taxes to mitigate it.},

I first present an overview of the theory and past work that has tried to address this question. As a test of these approaches, I then examine 822 populations of vertebrate species. I show that 72\% of time series required at least 10 years of continuous monitoring in order to achieve a high level of statistical power. However, the large variability between populations casts doubt on commonly used simple rules of thumb, such as those employed by the IUCN Red List. I argue that statistical power needs to be considered more often in monitoring programs. Short time series are likely underpowered and potentially misleading.},

	abstract = {We propose an integrated sampling, rarefaction, and extrapolation methodology to compare species richness of a set of communities based on samples of equal completeness (as measured by sample coverage) instead of equal size. Traditional rarefaction or extrapolation to equal-sized samples can misrepresent the relationships between the richnesses of the communities being compared because a sample of a given size may be sufficient to fully characterize the lower diversity community, but insufficient to characterize the richer community. Thus, the traditional method systematically biases the degree of differences between community richnesses. We derived a new analytic method for seamless coverage-based rarefaction and extrapolation. We show that this method yields less biased comparisons of richness between communities, and manages this with less total sampling effort. When this approach is integrated with an adaptive coverage-based stopping rule during sampling, samples may be compared directly without rarefaction, so no extra data is taken and none is thrown away. Even if this stopping rule is not used during data collection, coverage-based rarefaction throws away less data than traditional size-based rarefaction, and more efficiently finds the correct ranking of communities according to their true richnesses. Several hypothetical and real examples demonstrate these advantages.},

We explore the developments in measuring biodiversity that was prompted by the 2010 target. We consider measures based on species proportions, and also explain why a geometric mean of relative abundance estimates was preferred to such measures for assessing progress towards the target. We look at the use of diversity profiles, and consider how species similarity can be incorporated into diversity measures. We also discuss measures of turnover that can be used to quantify shifts in community composition arising, for example, from climate change.},
