# Introduction

## Treats on streams 

- Land-use changes: @piet_climate_2010 in Climate change ...
  - Forest vs drained = retained water vs greater run-off 
  - River morphology: canalization, lost of connection

- Climate change on stream hydrology:@piet_climate_2010
  - More variable discharge regimes (south england): higher peaks in winters
    (less winter droughts)
    - higher flow redistributes resources homogenize water chemestry 
    - lower flow: less oxygen, dried banks -> decrease stability

- Temperature and hydrological factors on fishes: @hering_monitoring_2010
  - changes of rivers discharges: decrease species richness and change life
    cycles 
  - Increasing temperature: threat to cold stenothermic species, confined in
    headwaters due to the reduction of available cold waters

- Acidication due to emission of S and N in the atmosphere @wright_interaction_2010
  - Highest pick in the 1980's, particularly severe in scandinavia
  - Dramatic reduction after worldwide agreement on S and N emission (goal in
    1999: -50% S and -20% N in 2010 relative to 1980) 
  - increasing temperature: accelerated mineralization and increase of acidification

## Biodiversity

- Land-use change and species climatic tolerance: 
  - loss of semi-natural habitat leaded to faster declines of thermal sensitive fishes [@williams_vertebrate_2021]
  - temperature differences linked to land-use (average daily maximum temperature)

# Biodiversity:


## LPI

### Chain method

Chain method is for poor timeseries with (n < 6) [@collen_monitoring_2009].

$i$: a population
$j$: a species
$t$: a time step 

$d_{i,j,t} = \log_{10}(\dfrac{N_{i,j,t}}{N_{i,j,t-1}}) = \log_{10}N_{i,j,t} - \log_{10}N_{i,j,t-1}$

where $N_t$ is the abundance of a given population $i$ of the species $j$ at time $t$.

One percent of the mean population measure value for the whole time series was
added to all years in time series for which N was zero in any year. Missing
values were imputed with log-linear interpolation:

$N_t = N_p (\dfrac{N_s}{N_p})^{\dfrac{t-s}{s-p}}$ 

with $p$ the previous time step with measured value and $s$ the subsequent year
with a measured value.

### GAM method

Set a GAM for each timeseries and report the predicted abundance values each
year. There are rules of thumbs to automatically set the smoothing parameters [see @collen_monitoring_2009].

Following, $d_{i,j,t}$ are computed with the predicted abundance values.

### LPI computation 

If a species has several populations, the annual species trends is computed as
the average[^1] of local population trends:

$d_{j,t} = \dfrac{1}{n}\sum_{i = 1}^{n} d_{i,j,t}$

It is a geometric mean because it the arithmetic mean of log transformed values of $N$: 

$\sum_{i = 1}^{n} d_{i,j,t} = \sum_{i = 1}^{n} (\log_{10}N_{i,j,t} - \log_{10}N_{i,j,t-1})$

The standardized index for a species is then computed as:

$I_{j, t} = I_{j, t - 1} 10^{d_{j,t}}$, $I_0 = 1$

### Confidence limits

Bootstrap on the selection of the $n_j$ population.

### Misc

- LPI:
  - @mcrae_diversity-weighted_2017; @capdevila_global_2021
  - [rlpi R package](https://github.com/Zoological-Society-of-London/rlpi)

#### Note on the geometric mean: @buckland_geometric_2011

- Because it measures proportional changes, low change in absolute abundance in a rare
    species can lead a big change in the geometric mean
- Based on above, the geometric is linked to eveness

How $G_t$ is linked to eveness ?

$G_t = exp(\dfrac{1}{n} \sum_{i = 1}^{n} (\log N_{i,j,t} - \log N_{i,j,t-1}))$

If we look at multicative change in species proportion:

$\dfrac{p_{i,t}}{p_{i,t-1}} = exp((\log N_{j, t} - \log N_t) - (\log N_{j, t-1} - \log N_{t-1}))$

where $N_t = \sum_{j=1} N_{j,t}$

if $n$ stays constant between $G_t$ and  $G_{t-1}$ 

If total abundances stays constant between years, i.e. $N_t = N_{t-1}$,

$\dfrac{p_{i,t}}{p_{i,t-1}} = exp(\log N_{j, t} - \log N_{j, t-1})$, then

$G_t = exp(\dfrac{1}{n} \sum_{i = 1}^{n} \log p_{i,j,t} - \dfrac{1}{n} \sum_{i = 1}^{n} \log p_{i,j,t-1})$

"The mean of the log species proportions has the key property of an evenness
measure, in that it attains its maximum value when all the species proportions
are equal: $p_{i,t} = 1/n$ for all $i$".


### Avantages

- Not biais for detectability variation between species
  - but biais if detectability change through time within species
- LPI change even if evenness stays the same (contrary to shannon and simpson)


- Linked to within-species (population) construction and reference to a baseline year:
  - no differences if units are abundance, biomass, density
  - combine trends of really different survey 

- Rescale:
  - if a new survey began in 2000, the index of 2000 for the this new survey
    should be scaled to value of the composite index of 2000 
  - if an abundant species become too rate to be included in the index, rescale
    as this: for the final year which the species is included compute the index
    with and without the species, the latter need to be rescale to match the
    former. Same rescaling is necessary for all subsequent years.

### Disaventages

- Do not work when when relative abundance is 0: 
  - one can add small numbers to 0 but the indice is sensible to the chosen
    quantity + poor precision with rarely recorded species. 
  - Shannon and Simpson are not influenced by rare species 
  - Problem can be reduced if observed count are modeled before index
    computation


## Extirpation

- extirpation / colonisation
  - [@baeten_model-based_2014]

## Turnover

- Temporal turnover: 
  - abundance based:
    - @shimadzu_measuring_2015 (between two time steps), considers a turnover
      metric decomposed based either on total abundance or species composition.
      - Linked to Shannon's: species richness and heterogeneity
      - Linked to Bray-Curtis decomposition: species richness and heterogeneity
  - See [BAT R package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/BAT/index.html) [@cardoso_bat_2015]
