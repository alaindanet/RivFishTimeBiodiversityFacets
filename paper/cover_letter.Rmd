We are herewith submitting a revision of our manuscript entitled “Past and
recent anthropogenic pressures drive rapid changes in riverine fish communities”
for consideration in Nature Ecology and Evolution.

We have now completed a careful and detailed revision of our manuscript by
incorporating suggestions and comments from the three reviewers. This has led us
to (i) provide more information regarding the site selection, (ii) clarify some
parts of the methods regarding the structure of the Bayesian models, (iii)
provide additional information regarding the potential influence of the
characteristics of the time series on the temporal trends (presented in new
Figures S2-S5), and (iv) explore the relationships between different human
footprint indices. We also carefully dealt with more minor comments by
incorporating the suggestions of the reviewers, as well as added some contextual
information regarding the degree of anthropogenic pressures to the Supplementary
Map.

We think the revised manuscript is much improved, and we thank you very much for
considering our revised manuscript. A point-by-point
response to the reviewers’ comments, as well as a document highlighting the
changes incorporated in the manuscript are included in the submission packet.
