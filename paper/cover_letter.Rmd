Dear Chief editor Patrick Goymer, dear Senior Editors,

Please find enclosed our manuscript entitled "Past and recent anthropogenic
pressures drive rapid changes in riverine fish communities", which we submit for
consideration in Nature in Ecology & Evolution.

In the midst of the current biodiversity crisis, it is now more important than
ever to understand the dynamics and drivers of biodiversity changes in order to
design and implement adapted conservation policies. This is particularly true in
freshwater systems, which are considered among the most threatened in the world.
Yet, despite broad scientific consensus on the global biodiversity decline, we
still lack a clear understanding of the processes underlying local community
changes in response to anthropogenic pressures. It remains a challenging task as
anthropogenic pressures can have both negative and positive effects on total
abundance and species richness through habitat degradation and introduction of
widespread generalist species. Local community composition and changes are also
influenced by long lasting effects of past anthropogenic pressures as well as by
the effects of connectivity which control the opportunity for community
dynamics.

We addressed this challenging task by investigating the effects of both past and
recent changes in anthropogenic pressures over space and time in riverine fish
communities. Using a compilation of more than 4,000 fish community timeseries
located in several biogeographic realms (mainly Palearctic, Nearctic and
Australasian), we related changes in community structure (total abundance and
species richness), composition (temporal dissimilarity and turnover), and
non-native species contribution to past and recent anthropogenic pressures. Our
results confirmed a global increase in fish species richness and total abundance
over time, but revealed that those increases are associated with important
species replacement and changes in dominance, together with an upsurge in the
proportion of non-native species observed in historically degraded sites,
reflecting a legacy of past anthropogenic pressures. We further uncovered an
interacting effect with recent changes in anthropogenic pressures, such as sites
that had been further degraded do not display increases in total abundance and
species richness but faster species replacement, changes in dominance, and
increases in the share of non-native species.

Our study provides a large-scale picture of the biodiversity trends in an
important freshwater group, but also a better understanding of the drivers
underlying community changes in an era of dramatic environmental pressures. Our
results are coherent with the abundant literature reporting an ongoing biotic
homogenization of riverine fish communities at the global scale, and suggest
that recent increases in species richness and total abundance at the local scale
are due to adaptation to highly degraded environments rather than recent
improvements in water quality as suggested in previous studies. Finally, the
weak covariation of community changes that we reported among different community
metrics together with the high spatial heterogeneity in community trajectories
highlights the multidimensional nature of community changes and the need to
account for the complex spatio-temporal patterns in the underlying drivers of
changes when assessing the status and trends in biodiversity.

As Nature in Ecology & Evolution has been at the forefront of the research on
large-scale patterns in biodiversity trends, we are confident that our study
will interest the broad readership of the journal and will stimulate exciting
new perspectives and research on local biodiversity changes at large spatial
scale. We think that the methods used to disentangle community variations in
space from changes in time will be of interest for a large readership. Lastly,
this study will be of high interest for freshwater scientists and conservation
practitioners as we provide the first comprehensive analysis of riverine fish
community changes at this scale. The enclosed manuscript has been edited and
approved by all the authors and has not been published or submitted to any other
journal. We had no prior discussions with a Nature Ecology & Evolution editor
about the work described in the manuscript.
