Scientists reach a consensus on the fact that biodiversity is going through an
unprecedented crisis. Predictions indicates that if we do not act strongly and
quickly, this crisis could have dramatic consequences that have not been seen

???
This is particularly true for freshwater ecosystems. Although freshwater
constitute 0.01% of water on earth, they host almost 9.5% of Earth described
species. Freshwater biodiversity is threatened by terrestrial land degradation,
overexploitation, pollution, flow alteration and species alteration.

However we know little on temporal dynamics of freshwater fishes are affected by
those anthropogenic pressures.

## Multidimensional concept

1. Species richness, Shannon, Simpson (Hill numbers) 
1. Total abundance
1. Dissimilarity in species composition (P/A or abundance based)

]



???
When an ecologist sampled a community in time, he faces a difficult task. Indeed, how to
describe the trends in biodiversity of this community? 

Is it the number of species, the total abundance, the dissimilarity of the
community composition through time? Should I take in account the abundance of
the species, in other word, compute Hill numbers ?

Of course, this is no one good answer. But measuring several of them, when
possible, can help us to refine our understanding biodiversity changes.  
An alternative hypothesis is that biodiversity trends are similar among them,
and that we might need only a few.

# Fish data: RivFishTime


`r nrow(site_cl_na)` sites, spanning at least 10 years

Homogeneity within sites: protocol, abundance units, sampling period

```{r, out.width="70%"}
tar_load(map_modelling_site)
mymap <- map_modelling_site +
  coord_sf(expand = FALSE)
save_plot(here::here("talk", "images", "map_sites.png"), mymap,

)
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("talk", "images", "map_sites.png"))
```


.footnote[`r Citet(bib, "comte_rivfishtime_2021")`]

???
To answer those questions, we used the RivFishTime database which contains time
series of fish communities spanning at least 10 years. The dataset covers mostly
the so called "Western countries": the US and Canada, Western and North Europe,
Australia and Japan. For each site, we selected samplings that were identical in
terms of protocol, measurement unit and sampling season. 
After selection, we had more than 5000 sites.

# Biodiversity facets

- Temporal dissimilarity:
  - Simpson based dissimilarity
  - Jaccard (Presence / absence):
    - Appearance and Disappearance 
    - Turnover and Nestedness 

- Chao richness
- Total abundance

- Complementary descriptors:
  - Percentage of exotic species richness 
  - Percentage of exotic species abundance

???
We characterised biodiversity by temporal dissimilarity of community
composition: based on abundance (with Simpson), presence/absence with the
Jaccard index. We also decomposed Jaccard in Appearance/Disappearance and
Nestedness/Turnover

We also described the Coverage based species richness (the Chao) and Total
abundance.

We also described the composition of communities in terms of exotic species

???
We modelled the temporal trends of biodiversity using hierarchical linear models evaluated with INLA,
a bayesian framework that approximates posterior distribution and thus do not
rely on MCMC.

The biodiversity at a site i and time t is linearly dependent on time,
covariates and on the interaction among the covariates

We added random effects on the intercept, alpha and on the temporal trends
quantified by the slope beta 0.
The variance of the intercept and the temporal trends were dependent on the
hydrographic basin and on the site, nested within the basin effect.

year 1993 and the recent change in pressure quantified by the ratio between the
human footprint of 2009 and the one of 1993
