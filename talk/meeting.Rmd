## Documenting community changes

- Many papers report local species richness and temporal trends
  - Abundance [@klink_meta-analysis_2020]
  - Species richness: [@vellend_global_2013; @dornelas_assemblage_2014]

- Other aspects of community structure vary through time:
  - Composition: [@dornelas_assemblage_2014; @hillebrand_biodiversity_2018]
  - Functional diversity [@barnagaud_temporal_2017]
  - Evenness (ref)

## Why do we want to assess community changes ? {.flexbox .vcenter}

- Global changes have affect a tremendous effect communities
- Understanding assembly and disassembly rules
- Give a more complex and complete picture of what is going on ?

<div class="notes">
- Global changes affect greatly community
- Understanding
- Contradictory results

So, we want to refine our assessment, to give a more complex picture of it

</div>


## Link between different facets of biodiversity


- Species richness:
  - Evenness / richness: (+) [@soininen_relationship_2012]
  - FDiv / richness: (+) [@mouchet_functional_2010]
  - FEve / richness: (O) [@mouchet_functional_2010]
  ... to complete

<div class="notes">
Link to assembly rules
</div>

## Space for time substitution

- Facet relationships come from space-for-time substitution

- Assume an homology between variation in space and variation in time

<div class="notes">

- Turnover in space, dispersal limitation can limit  

</div>

## Research gaps

- Few facets of biodiversity have been documented in time 
- Relationships between facet temporal trends are even more scarce 

## Research Questions  

1. How do communities change through time ?
   - Richness, Evenness, Disparity 
2. How to species characteristics explains community change ?
   - Life history traits, trophic position, ... 
   - Make a typology of declining and increasing species

# 

## How to measure biodiversity through time ?

- Three index categories [@daly_ecological_2018]:
  1. Richness: number of species, number of individuals
    - $S$, $N$
  2. Evenness: distribution of species abundance 
    - vector of species relative abundances $p = (p_1, ..., p_S)$  
  3. Disparity: between species, i.e. functional, taxonomic, phylogenetic, ... 

<div class="notes">

Disparity: other index are often defined as species-neutral diversity 

</div>

## How do composition change ? 

- Species exchange index: [@hillebrand_biodiversity_2018]
  - $SER_r = \dfrac{S_{imm} + S_{lost}}{S_{tot}}$ based on presence absence
  - $SER_a = \dfrac{\sum_i (p_i - p^{\prime}_i)^2}{\sum_i p_i^2 + \sum_i p^{\prime2}_i - \sum_i p_i p^{\prime}_i}$ 

- Abundance based (between two time steps)[@shimadzu_measuring_2015]:
  - considers a turnover metric decomposed based
    either on total abundance or species composition.

<div class="notes">

</div>
 
## To keep in mind 

We want to measure dimension of biodiversity that are not related to each other.

- One measure reflecting richness 
- One measure reflecting composition

<div class="notes">

Should we look at Hill numbers? like $q \right 1 = \mathrm{shannon}$,
q = 2, Gini-Simpson

</div>

## Multi-site version of community change

<div class="columns-2">
 
- Based on deviance: [@baeten_model-based_2014]
    - Omnipresent and rare species have the same contribution to the
      heterogeneity in community composition

![Figure 1](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/6065732e-217f-48fb-bb34-828238e42705/mee312137-fig-0001-m.jpg){width=40%}

</div>

- $D_i = -2n [p_i\log(p_i) + (1-p_i)\log(1-p_i)]$

- We can look at the contribution of each species (convergence or divergence)

<div class="notes">

The sum of
the deviances of the species-level models (i.e. our deviance
metric D = Î£Di ) equals the residual deviance of the single
binomial model y ij ~ Speciesi. The difference in the residual
deviance of separate models for each time period matches the
DD metric. Adding a Site effect term to the model, that is,
yij ~ Sitej + Speciesi, controls for the richness differences.
The residual deviance of this model, which we will call DT,
then quantifies the compositional heterogeneity due to turn-
over only.

# Population

## LPI 



- $d_{i,j,t} = \log_{10}(\dfrac{N_{i,j,t}}{N_{i,j,t-1}}) = \log_{10}N_{i,j,t} - \log_{10}N_{i,j,t-1}$


$i$: a population
$j$: a species
$t$: a time step 

- Trends by species: $d_{j,t} = \dfrac{1}{n}\sum_{i = 1}^{n} d_{i,j,t}$

- LPI: $I_{j, t} = I_{j, t - 1} 10^{d_{j,t}}$, $I_0 = 1$

- Confidence interval: bootstrap on the selection of the $n_j$ populations by
  species.

<div class="notes">

$N_t = N_p (\dfrac{N_s}{N_p})^{\dfrac{t-s}{s-p}}$ 

</div>

## Computation of the LPI 

- Missing values: 
  - imputed by log linear interpolation: $N_t = N_p (\dfrac{N_s}{N_p})^{\dfrac{t-s}{s-p}}$ 
  - imputed by a GAM

- Dealing with 0: 
  - add a small quantity to 0 
  - GAM get mostly rid of it

## Properties of the LPI

- Pro:
  - Proportional changes, low change in absolute abundance in a rare
      species can lead a big change in the geometric mean
  - No biais for detectability variation between species
  - no differences if units are abundance, biomass, density
  - combine trends of really different survey 

- Con:
  - no differences if units are abundance, biomass, density
  - combine trends of really different survey 


# For next time 
 
##


- Homogenize temporal series:
  - timing of fishing
